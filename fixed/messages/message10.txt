1. execute

It appears that we have reached the Edge, that zenith where stimuli and comatose collide.
Forty years ago, THE MAN proclaimed the Age of the Gross to be upon us, and even though THE
MAN was destroying our heritage and insulting our intelligence,
that era has become very real.
We labor for pleasure and abhor the guilt of pressure.
My generation will go down as the architects of contemporary disgust.
Some have fought and died.
Others have allowed the strong to be butchered for a price they themselves don't care about
and will never understand.
I myself am beleaguered by the selfish face of a kind of man that is NOT MANKIND.
Distrust in information.
Fundamentalism of opinion.
Catastrophic boredom, and a fanatical devotion to that which DOES NOT MATTER.
Where is your glory now, people?
Where are your gods and politicians?
Where is your shame and salvation?
You Rage For No Reason Because You Have No Reason.

WHAT HAVE YOU EVER FOUGHT FOR?
WHAT HAVE YOU EVER BLED FOR?
THE FACE OF THE EARTH IS SCARRED WITH THE WALKING DEAD.
THE AGE OF THE GROSS IS A LIVING VIRUS.
THIS IS THE FUTURE YOU HAVE CREATED.
THIS IS THE WORLD YOU HAVE SET ABLAZE.
ALL YOUR LIES ARE COMING TRUE.
ALL FREEDOM IS LOST.
ALL HOPE IS GONE.


2. Gematria (The Killing Name)

12/08/73 - that was all I got and now you got me

All I ever really wanted was to take the blame
I will go down in History and not down in Flames
Meningitis / I will survive this / Dry Sockets and a Schizophrenic Crisis
The Time of The Nine has begun
Get out of the way or you will suffer as one

This is so TYPICAL / APOCALYPTICAL
Hanging on abysmal release / Jesus
I don't need this / Don't wanna be this
Icon in the Making / My hands are fucking shaking

WHAT IF GOD DOESN'T CARE?
WHAT IF GOD DOESN'T CARE...

Remember / Surrender / The Time is Now
Continue / We're in you... and we will BURN YOUR CITIES DOWN

AMERICA IS A KILLING NAME
IT DOESN'T FEEL OR DISCRIMINATE
LIFE IS JUST A KILLING FIELD
IT'S ALL THAT'S LEFT - NOTHING'S REAL
THROW AWAY YOUR DISPOSABLE PAST
AND FALL APART LIKE A CIGARETTE ASH
WE ARE THE FATAL AND VITAL ONES OF THE WORLD
AND WE WILL BURN YOUR CITIES DOWN

WHAT IF GOD DOESN'T CARE?
WHAT IF GOD DOESN'T CARE?

AMERICA IS A KILLING NAME
IT DOESN'T FEEL OR DISCRIMINATE
LIFE IS JUST A KILLING FIELD
IT'S ALL THAT'S LEFT - NOTHING'S REAL
THROW AWAY YOUR DISPOSABLE PAST
AND FALL APART LIKE A CIGARETTE ASH
WE ARE THE FATAL AND VITAL ONES OF THE WORLD
AND WE WILL BURN YOUR CITIES DOWN

Down...

WE WILL BURN YOUR CITIES DOWN

Feed the Hungry - Feed them shit
Feed them BONES and POLITICS
You wanna revolutionize?
Be specific and believe your eyes
Start a war in another backyard
And we'll destroy your house of cards
Give me a minute and I'll change your mind
Give me a bullet and I'll change your life

Remember / Surrender / The Time is Now
Continue / We're in you...
And we will BURN YOUR CITIES DOWN

AMERICA IS A KILLING NAME
IT DOESN'T FEEL OR DISCRIMINATE
LIFE IS JUST A KILLING FIELD
IT'S ALL THAT'S LEFT - NOTHING'S REAL
THROW AWAY YOUR DISPOSABLE PAST
AND FALL APART LIKE A CIGARETTE ASH
WE ARE THE FATAL AND VITAL ONES OF THE WORLD
AND WE WILL BURN YOUR CITIES DOWN

WE WILL BURN YOUR CITIES DOWN

America... what if "God" doesn't care?


3. Sulfur

My Guilt and My Shame always sell me short - always feel the same
And My Face and My Soul always wear me thin - always under control
But the longest hours you'll have in your life
Are the ones you sit through to know if you're right
So I'll wait, but I pray that I'm wrong
Because I think I know what's going on

So Let Me Get This Straight... the only will is my own
I do whatever I want and stay alone
All my decisions make it untouchable and tainted
I'm gonna suffer for the rest of my life
But I will always find a way to survive
I'm not a failure, but I know what it's like
I can take it or leave it... or die

STAY - You don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like Breathing in Sulfur...

My Life is undone - and I'm a sinner to most but a sage to some
And my Gods are Untrue - I'm probably wrong, but I'm better than you
And the longest hours I've had in my life
Were the ones I went through to know I was right
So I'm safe, but I'm a little outside
I'm gonna laugh when I'm buried alive

STAY - You don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like Breathing in Sulfur...

LIKE BREATHING IN SULFUR

STAY - You don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like Breathing in Sulfur...

LIKE BREATHING IN SULFUR


4. Psychosocial

I did my time and I want out
So effusive - Fade - It doesn't cut
The soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning - The sickening
Packaging subversion
Pseudo sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts - Go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in - getting smaller again
I'm Done! It has begun - I'm not the only one!

[Chorus:]
And the rain will kill us all...
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Psychosocial!

There are cracks in the road we laid
But where the devil fell
The secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had
Who needs another mess?
We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now theres only emptiness
Venomous, Insipid
I think we're done - I'm not the only one!

[Chorus]

THE LIMIT'S OF THE DEAD!

Fake Anti-Fascist lie - (Psychosocial!)
I tried to tell you but - (Psychosocial!)
Your purple hearts are giving out - (Psychosocial!)
Can't stop a killing idea - (Psychosocial!)
If it's hunting season - (Psychosocial!)
Is this what you want? - (Psychosocial!)
I'm not the only one!

[Chorus 2x]

The limits of the dead...


5. Dead Memories

Sitting in the dark, I can't forget.
Even now, I realize the time I'll never get.
Another story of the Bitter Pills of Fate.
I can't go back again. I can't go back again...
But you asked me to love you and I did.
Traded my emotions for a contract to commit

And when I got away, I only got so far. The Other Me Is Dead.
I hear his voice inside my head...
We were never alive, and we won't be born again.
But I'll never survive with Dead Memories in my heart.
You told me to love you and I did. Tied my soul into a knot and got me to submit.

So when I got away, I only kept my scars. The Other Me Is Gone.
Now I don't know where I belong...
We were never alive, and we won't be born again.
But I'll never survive with Dead Memories in my heart.
Dead Visions in your Name.
Dead Fingers in my Veins.
Dead Memories in my Heart


6. Vendetta

I know my uses / I have my pride / But my heart is still untamed
I learned my lessons / I've conquered Death / I go on and I'm unashamed
I'll paint your bones to match my eyes / They're the darkest I have ever seen
Until I'm lucid, I can't be told
I know my voices / They tell me to BELIEVE

Another fucking accident out of control / All the attitudes will never change
My Imitations are leading the way
I can't accept that I still don't find this strange

In light of my ability to feel denial
I walk away from everything with just a smile
The Agony of Coming Home has gone away
It's Everywhere / It's Everyone / It's Every Day

ARE YOU READY FOR THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE

I beg your pardon / I'm out of the way / A new conspiracy has taken my place
So over and over, I smell the decay
Believe what you want to - The Cycle Stays The Same

In light of my ability to undermine
I walk away from apathy - I'm feeling fine
The Agony of Cynicism beckons me
It's Everywhere / It's Everyone / It's Everything

ARE YOU READY FOR THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE

LET'S - PRETEND - WE'RE NOT AT THE END
PRETEND - THAT WE HAVE NOTHING LEFT

ARE YOU READY FOR THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE

LET'S - PRETEND - WE'RE NOT AT THE END
PRETEND - THAT WE HAVE NOTHING LEFT


7. Butcher's Hook

Contrite - Commercial - Arrogance - Leprosy
Consume The Bitch - The Fucker - Mindless - Like A Child
For Pity's Sake - I've Had All That I Can Take
We Try - But In The End We'll See
There Are No More Codes
Only Who Is Shit / And Who's Still Free
I was gonna change the world with Honor and Aggression
No one listened - no one cared
All they saw was misdirection

GO AHEAD AND DISAGREE / I'm giving up again...

I DON'T WANT YOU ANYMORE
I DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE
Fingerprint of God / Your new religions covet
This vessel wasn't built to last
But I will live forever/ you'll never have to say surrender
Because you're so part of it
My total honesty has no place for Tomorrow
Guilty pleasures give me pain
Tell my people I CAN'T FOLLOW

GO AHEAD AND DISAGREE / I'm giving up again...

You'll never CENSOR me / You'd better CHERISH me
My REASON has a voice / Freedom's gone but we'll always have a CHOICE
My PRESENT FUTURE TENSE / It doesn't make much SENSE
I'm coming after you / FUCK YOU ALL I'M THE ONLY POINT OF VIEW

Violence and Dollar Signs / Another processed piece of shit
You hide your fault in DIAMONDS and give away the only
COST - you can't delay the inevitable
LOST - don't understand the incredible path
I'm losing ground - but I won't care when I go down

GO AHEAD AND DISAGREE / I'm giving up again...

I'M GIVING UP AGAIN


8. Gehenna

Do you Believe? Do you Fade like a Dream?
Let me hear you BREATHE
Let me watch as you sleep
The Sparrow's Eyes... Promises shift into judgments
I cannot deny that you were designed for my punishments

The Blood and The Body - Control the cut so it's seamless
Show me your Heart - Show me the way to complete this
TETHERED / to a scene I / TREASURE / can you help me?
I / SEVER/ god it's perfect, it's / NEVER / really perfect
Now... I can finally be myself
Cuz I don't want to be myself

FREE MY SEVERED HEART, GIVE ME YOU - I WANT IT
(I don't want to be myself)

I cannot maintain a semblance of Normal anymore
I'd rather feel pain than try to fit in with you anymore
I'll throw it all away, like everybody else
I can finally be myself
Cuz I don't want to be myself

FREE MY SEVERED HEART, GIVE ME YOU - I WANT IT
(I don't want to be myself)


9. This Cold Black

Mother Nature is a Coward (Mother Nature is a Whore)
No More Presence / No More Power (I pray for death, by the hour)
Cut Another Smile Into Me (Into ME is All You Are)
My Artifice won't Recognize Me (You won't find me)... Anymore

Post-Traumatic War Machines / The Pessimists still won't believe
Throw away my past mistakes / It's all I can to feel
Let my weapons be you CHILDREN / Let my armies be your DAMNED
Try to suffer on in silence / TRY TO STOP ME IF YOU CAN

PNEUMATIC DESTROYER - PATHETIC SEDUCER
DISTORTION SUFFICIENT
SOME DAY - ONE DAY - WE'LL LIVE OUR LIVES AGAIN

My Ghosts Have Found Their Way Back Home
I have every right to kill my own
I am something now that never could exist
My Anguish Conquers All / Pay The Price And Watch Me Fall
My Only Key Is Broken - My Broken Key Is Only... ME

PNEUMATIC DESTROYER - PATHETIC SEDUCER
DISTORTION SUFFICIENT
SOME DAY - ONE DAY - WE'LL LIVE OUR LIVES AGAIN

You utter waste of tired flesh - It doesn't matter if you can't progress
Even now they still create me - Give me your ignorance / IRRITATE ME
I am made of the same debris - You want it all but you didn't want me
Hypocrite with no real use - I'm alive... what's your excuse?

PNEUMATIC DESTROYER - PATHETIC SEDUCER
DISTORTION SUFFICIENT
SOME DAY - ONE DAY - WE'LL LIVE OUR LIVES AGAIN
PNEUMATIC DESTROYER - PATHETIC SEDUCER
DISTORTION SUFFICIENT
SOME DAY - ONE DAY - WE'LL LIVE OUR LIVES AGAIN

WE'LL LIVE OUR LIVES AGAIN


10. Wherein Lies Continue

THOU SHALT NOT
Kill your Fathers - Destroy another Life
Question everything we clung to for years
Live Forever - Design a Better Death
Confuse a liar with a savior from fear
Create a Myth and Separate the Chosen Ones
Adolescent Independence / Dominion
I only wanna believe in fuckin' anything
But now my conscience is contradicting everything

THE ENDING'S THE SAME / THE WORLD WILL NOT CHANGE
THE ANSWER IS CLEAR...

Tell your Mothers they have no Sons or Daughters
Blame yourselves because your Children are Mine
We are Orphans, but we are not Forgotten
And we will find a way to save us this time
We can run, but we are tired of running
We're dropping seconds in a glass 'til we die
We only wanna believe in fuckin' everything
But we're alive and we're not accepting anything

THE ENDING'S THE SAME / THE WORLD WILL NOT CHANGE
THE ANSWER IS CLEAR... ANNIHILATION

I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm STRONGER BETTER
They gave to me now I give to you the means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm STRONGER BETTER MORE

WE HAVE TO SAVE OURSELVES

I will never become another piece
Inside the Paralytic Construct I hate
Live Forever? Well, I would rather die
At least I'd know I wasn't theirs to create
This is yours, but you had better choose
Before they take away your right to decide
I guess I'll never believe in fuckin' anything
But my solace is I CAN HANDLE EVERYTHING

THE ENDING'S THE SAME / THE WORLD WILL NOT CHANGE
THE ANSWER IS CLEAR... OBLITERATION

I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm STRONGER BETTER
They gave to me now I give to you the means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm STRONGER BETTER
I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm STRONGER BETTER
They gave to me now I give to you the means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm STRONGER BETTER
MORE

WE HAVE TO SAVE OURSELVES


11. Snuff

Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again...

So if you love me, let me go.
And run away before I know.
My heart is just too dark to care.
I can't destroy what isn't there.
Deliver me into my fate -
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you...
My smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light
But all of that was ripped apart...
when you refused to fight

So save your breath, I will not hear.
I think I made it very clear.
You couldn't hate enough to love.
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend.
Then I could hurt you in the end.
I never claimed to be a saint...
My own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away - you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control...
My love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know...


12. All Hope Is Gone

The state of the nation - violation!
A broken promise is as good as a lie.
The hell is humongous, the devil's among us
and we will burn because we won't unite!

What are we conceding for our freedom?
Why does anybody think we need 'em
I would rather fight,
than let another die.
We're the problem,
but we're also the solution.
ALL HOPE IS GONE!!!

If you want it come and take it from me.
If you think you can, you still don't know me.
Let me tell you, man, when I said it, I meant it
and I will always have the right to defend it.

Fifty seconds, a hundred murders.
The bill of rights is a bill of sale.
What will you do when the war is over?
What will you do when your system fails!?

We have made the present obsolete.
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way,
When all hope is gone!

We've seen the fall of the elite,
Bury your life, take your disease
We'll end the world,
When all hope is gone!

The wretched are the wounded,
The hungry starve to death,
In a place where no one goes,
The air itself is a final breath,
So discontinue, the anti-septic, care charade,
As a cry of justice comes,
A malignant fire fades.

I am the reason your future suffers,
I am the hatred you won't embrace
I am the worm of a pure gestation,
I am the remedy, spit in my face.
All your laws and rules are outdated,
All your subjects are killing the kings,
I can rattle off a million other reasons why,
But does it matter when the only thing we love will die?

We have made the present obsolete.
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way,
When all hope is gone!

We've seen the fall of the elite,
Bury your life, take your disease
We'll end the world,
When all hope is gone!
WHEN ALL HOPE IS GONE!!!

WHEN ALL HOPE IS GONE!!!

WHEN ALL HOPE IS GONE!!!


13. Child Of Burning Time

[Special Edition bonus track]

Child of burning time
The child of burning time

My only consolation is all lies
The apex of my consequence is dying here tonight
Winter has returned and it always looks like rain
I cant remember anything...anything
Inside the absolution is to come
And appetites are bittersweet I think I'm coming home
A chance to give up Avarice has marked my one regret
The child of burning time has gone, he hasn't come back, he hasn't come back yet

Before I tell my story please consider who I am
I missed my window years ago, I'm doing all I can
A tragedy is commonplace but in the end they go away
A skin is still the only stain I'm left to wear in shame
And I cut my need into my heart, I tear it all apart
I beg you burn me away, I won't become your hero just to fight the life I saved
Burn me away, I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today

I burn away
I burn away
I burn away
I burn away

My isolation is my course
The effect it has on life itself is a cancer on its source
I rue the moments spent between the fetish and the flame
Until this war is over I won't ever lose my rage

And I cut my need into my soul, I guess I'll never know
I beg you burn me away, I won't become your hero just to fight the life I saved
Burn me away, I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today

Burn me away, I wont become your hero just to fight the life I saved
Burn me away, I wont give up tomorrow just to lose it all, lose it all today


14. Vermilion Pt. 2 (Bloodstone Mix)

[Special Edition bonus track]

She seemed dressed in all of me
Stretched across my shame
All the torment and the pain
Leaked through and covered me
I'd do anything to have her to myself
Just to have her for myself
Now I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad

She is everything to me
The unrequited dream
A song that no one sings
The unattainable
She's a myth that I have to believe in
All I need to make it real is one more reason

I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad

But I won't let this build up inside of me

I catch in my throat
Choke
Torn into pieces
I won't - no
I don't wanna be this

But I won't let this build up inside of me

She isn't real
I can't make her real


15. Til We Die

[Special Edition bonus track]

My friends are all hurting from moments and regrets and charity laced with a lie
And still we keep hoping, to fix all the defects and strengthen these seminal ties
We go on together for better or worse, our history is to real to hate
Now and forever we stay until morning, and promise to fight for our fate

'Til we die
'Til we die

The start of the journey is every bit worth it, I can let you down anymore
The sky is still clearing, we're never afraid and the consequence opens the door
I've never stopped trying, I've never stopped feeling like family is much more than blood
Don't go on without me, the piece that I represent complements each and every one

'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've acheived has allowed us to win

'Til we die
'Til we die

My last true confession will open your eyes, I've never know trust like the nine
Let it be spoken, let it be screamed, they'll never ever take us alive

'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've acheived has allowed us to win

Carry on
Carry on

We'll never be broken, we won't be denied, our war is the pressure we need to deny
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied, our war is the pressure we need to deny

'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've acheived has allowed us to win

Carry on
Carry on

We'll never be broken, we won't be denied, our war is the pressure we need to deny

'Til we die
'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've acheived has allowed us to win
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied, our war is the pressure we need to deny

2. Unsainted

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I'll never kill myself to save my soul)
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I didn't come this far to sink so low)
I'm finally holding on to letting go

I'm just weathering a rough patch
Another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it
Pick a lord and you pray to it
You're so demanding when you want the truth
But your stories don't read for me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

Indecision overload
Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God
But did you think you'd shake your own?
This killing field is all grown over
The motherfucker wants it wild
Go sow your oats in alphabetical order
The anti-antagonist is back in style
Myopic, cannot see straight
Dystopic, one sin too late
You gotta lie if you wanna believe
But your bibles don't work on me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?
You've killed the saint in me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?


3. Birth Of The Cruel

(Let him crave understanding
Let him crave your wisdom
Let him crave
Let him... promote
Father... my self-control)

I'm just a Judas, looking for a silver line
And tomorrow is still a step behind
Hey hey drama, I'd love to be a waste of your time
Oh no, thanks so much for wasting mine
So hear me out

Let's hear it for the damaged
Who understands but the broken?
Developed in the arms of spite
I'm all fucked up and I make it look good
Adrenalin sight tonight

I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it

Sick, sickened, I'm sickening, I'm stricken by the fist
Blessed are the fires that have burned me
Listen to this, the lesson is, never underestimate the agony
Death of the fool, birth of the cruel

Remember how you spent the best part of forever in a state of pure disease
It was another thing altogether to forget that you brought out the worst in me
Hey Karma, you don't feel like I do
You just wish you'd hate like I do

We are the Bitter, the maladjusted and wise
Fighting off a generation too uptight
We're all dressed up with nobody to kill
The rhetoric stops tonight

I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it

Sick, sickened, I'm sickening, I'm stricken by the fist
Blessed are the fires that have burned me
Listen to this, the lesson is, never underestimate the agony
Death of the fool, birth of the...
Birth of the cruel!
Yeah!

Now's not the time for denying
Shifting the focus to scare
Let's not forget we're all guilty
All three dimensions polluted by earnest despair

I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it

(Let him crave understanding
Let him crave your wisdom
Let him crave
Let him... promote
Father... my self-control
That he can see and look at the enemy in front of him
And just goes, "Not today, sucker
Go back to Hell where you belong!")


4. Death Because Of Death

Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of you


5. Nero Forte

Watch this!

I'm never enough
You bleed me dry, using me up
Dissatisfied, and used
Another key to the empty spot in you
I'm sick as a fuck
I'm in my prime, what do you want?
I guess it's time, to see
If you're lost in hell you'll find no peace

Ooh, wade through hate and fear
I haven't felt like this in years
Not much left, so uprooted
Fists clenched tight in the pockets of my hoodie
And I know where I need to go
But the voice of reason can't say no
It's in the eyes, and heart
Just the latest psycho off the charts

That's what you do best!

A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

I know, and even if I didn't
I would lie so, many would believe it
Stand up and resist the chains
Of all the people in belligerent sick restraint
I wasn't enough
You bled me dry, which way is up?
Oh, you're a lie, and fake
I hope the truth is not too late

That's what you do best!

A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

That's what you do best!

That's what you do best...
That's what you do best... Hahahahahaha...

(WHY) Why was it easy for you?
(DID) Did I deserve the abuse?
(I) I can't believe I let it
(NOT) Not what I wanted
(SEE) See through your bullshit
(YOUR) You're so traumatic
(TRUE) True to your form of
(FACE) Every consequence
(UN) Unintimidated
(TIL) Till the very end
(IT) It'll never happen
(WAS) Was it all a lie?
(TOO) Many motherfuckers
(LATE) That's what you do best!
(LIE) That's what you do best!
(LIE) That's what you do best!

Oh, that's what you do best!

A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

A home like yours is upside down
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

That's what you do,
That's what you do best!
(What you, do best
What you, do best) Yeah!
(What you, do best
What you, do best
What you, do best
What you, do best)
That's what you do best!
That's what you do best!


6. Critical Darling

Yeah!

God's in a coma
Put Faith in a life support
Running away won't feel the same
If you reach a metaphysical last resort
Oh, malevolence and purgatory give you pause
It's a miracle you haven't broken any laws
We are not entitled to surviving
So keep your friends and your enemies thriving

(Good for you!) What a cliché...
(Just not true!) What a giveaway!
(What comes now!) Can't be the last one
Falling down!

Every time this happens I'm breaking a promise I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet and keep it away from the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

Once again, we got suffocated
In a sick perversion of a spider's web
Crawling over all the spent, digested pieces
Celebrate the dead
Here come all the judging eyes
Gotta pave the road with your best intentions
I only wish you could picture a future
That doesn't resemble your crazy inventions

(Good on you!) I don't mean it...
(Dream come true!) I don't need it!
(What goes up!) Another Hollow One
Must come down!

Every time this happens I'm breaking a promise I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet and keep it away from the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

A mirror only works if you open your eyes
But even then you have to understand what's inside
The easy part is always hardest to see
I know you'll never guess, but darling
You're so critical
Darling, you're so critical
Oh, you're so critical

Oh, this is a cave-in
The weight of the catalyst
Just wait, let the games begin
Gonna tell you all about it for the savages

(Good for you!) Not another one...
(Just not true!) Not another one!
(What comes now!) This world is
Falling down!

Every time this happens I'm breaking a promise I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet and keep it away from the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

It's begun!

Oh, you're so critical!
Yeah!
Oh, you're so critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!


7. A Liar's Funeral

The season at an end
A harvest of seclusion and regret
The burning can begin
A period of ash is what you get
The quiet is a curse
But my respect was shown to you by force
Another day too late
Another neck too eager for the rope

Liar
Liar

Yesterday was hard
Tomorrow is just a promise of the same
When friends have all subscribed
To spitting on the ground to say my name
Fire on the ice
December in the summer kills the heart
Your hate is no surprise
I guess I have to die to play my part

Liar
Liar

Ooh, close your eyes and join the blind
Slit your wrists for peace of mind
Turn your back and show us the truth
There's only one way to remember it for you

Burn, burn, burn, the liar
Burn, burn, burn, the liar
Burn, burn, burn, the liar
Burn, burn, burn, the liar

Hold the weight
Never trust the one beside you
Carried away
You know just as much as I do
Hold the weight
Do it all for what you really love
Carried away
Use you up until you've had enough

Hold the weight
Never trust the one beside you
Carried away
You know just as much as I do
Hold the weight
Do it all for what you really love
Carried away
Use you up until you've had enough

Clench your teeth and tighten your grip
Stand up straight, don't let it slip
Burn, burn, burn, the liar
Burn, burn, burn, the liar

True victims and survivors learn to make war
Don't wanna be the Sad Man Singing anymore
I did it all wrong so I'd get it all right
We're wasting all the candles, the dead need no light

Liar
Liar
Liar


8. Red Flag

Yeah!

Past just saving, this is like escaping
Running wild in the middle of weeds
Eyes can't see me, careful with your breathing
Get away or they get to feed
Strength's not enough, be defiant
You're looking for a reason to suffer, you'll find it
But if you want to live to be better, begin it
Your energy won't keep you from getting exhausted and purge it

You don't own me!
You can't hold me!
This is beginning!
You are an ending!

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

(Vultures, vultures, vultures, vultures
Vultures, vultures, vultures, vultures)

Vultures salivate poison to exterminate
It's the dawn of the Renaissance
Emancipation, cattle on displacement, you want
To reason but there is no response
I won't allow this to happen
Another situation I feel like I'm trapped in
Nothing is my business and business is gone
I wish you all could fuck off and go back to hell where you belong!

You don't own me!
You can't hold me!
This is beginning!
You are an ending!

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

Plague! (Plague!) Don't panic (Plague!)
Don't believe the riddle that confuses you
Bitch! (Bitch!) So manic (So manic!)
I can see the light that exposes you
So dramatic, now it's all emphatic means
The bigger the mouth that I can eat you with
Force of habit, God you reek of your havoc
But consider the sources you've been tampering with!

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

Now you're nothing!
Now you're nothing!
Now you're nothing new!
New!
Oh!
Yeah!


9. What's Next

[Instrumental]



10. Spiders

Well you can go it alone
Or keep it in between
The pages of the books you burn
So no one gets to read
The fingers pull your stitches tight
But knowing someone's secret is not enough
Everyone's a little bit a lot of the time

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

When now is not the time
Tomorrow disagrees
But your real world isn't ready to face
The face behind the real me
Time to think it over
I'm over trying to overthink, I've had enough, huh
Everybody's limited to what's on their mind

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

(Spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
(Spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)

Make yourself a martyr's pet
And watch them all escape (spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
Make yourself at home instead (spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
You'll lose your toxic waste (spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)

Go it alone
Suffer for your feelings, I'm not enough (no, no, no)
But everyone's a little bitter all of the time

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?


11. Orphan

I wept! When I realized
There were no more demons left to conquer
An opportunity to show my feelings
With skin so thick you'd swear it was armor
A penitentiary that only lets the oxygen out
I wasn't ready for a version of the truth to get out
I'm getting desperate, I wouldn't want to fester
In another bad dream, I am a man of extremes

I found the flesh and I'm liking it
I'll put an end to all your fucking psychobabble
We eat the meat 'cause the meat had a soul
We take their lives 'cause to hurt makes us whole

I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story, take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan, the one who kills your world

Keeping up appearances with acts of attrition
It doesn't matter 'cause I know you'll never listen
Before, you knew it when you saw it
Now you say you never knew it, it was all a big conspiracy
We come together when the hands of pain let go
Is there anybody left to fill this hole?
This shit will never wash off
Give yourself a medal, I swear I fucking give up

We're nothing special, just an accidental tweak of the freak
An evolution of the kennel in the fetish you seek
There's still the part of me that's dying in a dumpster
The one who rose is a motherfucking monster

I've seen the future, and it's simply burning!
I wasn't put here to be so discerning!
You want the world to be dissatisfied?!
You don't care, so why the fuck should I?
Fuck, should I sell myself to stay alive?

I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story, take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan, the one who kills...
The one who kills your world!

Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything

Tell me all about it
I'd love to hear it
The way I ruin everything I touch
I never thought I'd get to say I'm sorry
But then again I think you ask too much

Too white 2B black
Too black 2B blue
Too sick 2B me
Too fucked 2B you
I only wonder if I'll live to see the end of the road
It always gets me nowhere

I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story, take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan, the one who kills your world

Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
I am the orphan, the one who kills...
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
I am the orphan, the one who kills...

Yeah-hahahaha...


12. My Pain

Pain
She loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free to feel all of my pain

I'm your friend
And I'm your shade
Do what you want
Just remember it's for love

I'm your wall
And I'm your rock
Don't run away
Don't forget it's only love

I'm your chain
And I'm your lock
There's no escape
Just as long as I say... love

I'm your death
And I'm your cold
You end with me
Remember: this was never love
(Love, love, love, love)

I'll take this
(Love, love, love, love)
And I'll take that
(Love, love, love, love)
I'll take you too
(Love, love, love)
You can never give too much

Pain
She loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free
Pain

Pain
She loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free to feel all of my pain

I've always felt love this way for you


13. Not Long For This World

Cutting or scratching, they scar the same
The angle is off, the edges are soft, the mark remains
I know I'm bitter and full of rage
You would be too, what I've been through
Knowledge is a difficult age

So decide
Tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide
Tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see...
Not long for this world!

Carving or biting, we bleed for keeps
Out of control, into the cold, hell repeats
God, I'm starving, spreading me thin
Buying a story, my soul is for sale
Trust is such an arrogant thing

So decide
Tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide
Tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see...
Not long for this world!
Not long for this world!

I KNOW THE SHIT YOU EAT
There's nothing mellow in the
DRAMA YOU LIVE AND BREATHE
You like your secrets to be
KEPT IN THE FAMILY
You don't get credit for your
RARE GOOD BEHAVIOR, GO BE A SAVIOR
You don't seem to get what I'm saying...
And I'm sick and tired of explaining!
GOODNIGHT, GOODBYE, GOOD LUCK
There's nothing worse than a
GHOUL MANIFESTO, I'M NOT IMPRESSED THOUGH

The greatest conclusion that I ever had
Was when I woke up and said, "That's enough!"
Living never felt so bad
You don't accept it, and I don't care
Bury yourself above all your guilt
When you're ready it'll be there

So decide
Tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide
Tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see...
Not long for this world!
Not long for this world!
Not long for this world!

I was not long for this world...
I was not long for this world...

I was not long for this world!
I was not long for this world!
I was not long for this world!
I was not long for this world!


14. Solway Firth

Today, up on this hill, I'm counting all the killers
They sway as they swarm, a look of gluttons in their eyes
They mutter as the body loses warmth
They pick your bones like locks inside a tomb
And take great care to not take care of you
Here's an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one

While I was learning to live, we all were living a lie
I guess you got what you wanted
So I will settle for a slaughterhouse soaked in blood and betrayal
It's always somebody else, somebody else was me
You want the real smile?
Or the one I used to practice not to feel like a failure?

I don't need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don't need you to hide it from me
I just want to feel like any other man
I won't show you the whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away

Here's an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one

I'm not ahead of my time, I just drew the first breath
If I'm alive tomorrow
I will alleviate the pressure by cutting you out of me
I found my bottom line dead on the front lines
I know I'll never go home
So set fire to your ships and past regrets and be free

I don't need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don't need you to hide it from me
I just want to feel like any other man
I won't show you my whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away

Here's an unexplainable one
What have you done?
What have you done?
Yeah

Oh, while I was learning to live, you taught me how to die
I guess I got what I wanted
Another needle in the back through purified scarification
It wasn't somebody else, you fucking did it to me
You want a real smile?
I haven't smiled in years


15. All Out Life

[Japanese Bonus Track]

What a world, the horizon's
Coming like a hell-bent killing machine
Can't afford to be the goddamn wreckage
Burn it all again at a million degrees
Calling all the adamant upper-level
Undefeated counterfeit cunts with a reason to fear
Throw away all the meaningless shit that's clinging
The enemy is here, I said stop

Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
One by one against, give me the name
All you shiny pretty never-wills ruined the game
You hold all the keys, so the chains shouldn't hold you
I know you heard me, I fucking told you

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
No excuses, I challenge you to all out fucking life

Drop that shit and put it on a pedestal
Children are afraid of the gods
Raise your hands and show me what's impossible
That makes us even, never tell me the odds
What a bore, I'm getting stuck in a metaphor
I don't wanna go to sleep
I need a breakdown quick in negotiations
Get it all together and remember to seethe, stop

Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
Drive by violence, more of the same
I can see where you're going, and I'm really ashamed
Do you think when you act or just act like you're thinking?
I gotta know now, you better tell me

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
I challenge you to all out life

We are gathered here today to get it right
Repeat after me:
"I will not celebrate mediocrity
I will not worship empty shells
I will not listen to worthless noises
I will not subject myself to selected predictable choices
My time, my attention
My quality should not be bought and sold
For convenience's sake, ever"

We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
Pay attention, it's gonna be a while 'til I really feel alright
Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
No excuses, I challenge you to all out fucking life

All out life, yeah
I challenge you to all out fucking life, yeah
Live, live, live, life
1. execute

It appears that we have reached the Edge, that zenith where stimuli and comatose collide.
Forty years ago, THE MAN proclaimed the Age of the Gross to be upon us, and even though THE
MAN was destroying our heritage and insulting our intelligence,
that era has become very real.
We labor for pleasure and abhor the guilt of pressure.
My generation will go down as the architects of contemporary disgust.
Some have fought and died.
Others have allowed the strong to be butchered for a price they themselves don't care about
and will never understand.
I myself am beleaguered by the selfish face of a kind of man that is NOT MANKIND.
Distrust in information.
Fundamentalism of opinion.
Catastrophic boredom, and a fanatical devotion to that which DOES NOT MATTER.
Where is your glory now, people?
Where are your gods and politicians?
Where is your shame and salvation?
You Rage For No Reason Because You Have No Reason.

WHAT HAVE YOU EVER FOUGHT FOR?
WHAT HAVE YOU EVER BLED FOR?
THE FACE OF THE EARTH IS SCARRED WITH THE WALKING DEAD.
THE AGE OF THE GROSS IS A LIVING VIRUS.
THIS IS THE FUTURE YOU HAVE CREATED.
THIS IS THE WORLD YOU HAVE SET ABLAZE.
ALL YOUR LIES ARE COMING TRUE.
ALL FREEDOM IS LOST.
ALL HOPE IS GONE.


2. Gematria (The Killing Name)

12/08/73 - that was all I got and now you got me

All I ever really wanted was to take the blame
I will go down in History and not down in Flames
Meningitis / I will survive this / Dry Sockets and a Schizophrenic Crisis
The Time of The Nine has begun
Get out of the way or you will suffer as one

This is so TYPICAL / APOCALYPTICAL
Hanging on abysmal release / Jesus
I don't need this / Don't wanna be this
Icon in the Making / My hands are fucking shaking

WHAT IF GOD DOESN'T CARE?
WHAT IF GOD DOESN'T CARE...

Remember / Surrender / The Time is Now
Continue / We're in you... and we will BURN YOUR CITIES DOWN

AMERICA IS A KILLING NAME
IT DOESN'T FEEL OR DISCRIMINATE
LIFE IS JUST A KILLING FIELD
IT'S ALL THAT'S LEFT - NOTHING'S REAL
THROW AWAY YOUR DISPOSABLE PAST
AND FALL APART LIKE A CIGARETTE ASH
WE ARE THE FATAL AND VITAL ONES OF THE WORLD
AND WE WILL BURN YOUR CITIES DOWN

WHAT IF GOD DOESN'T CARE?
WHAT IF GOD DOESN'T CARE?

AMERICA IS A KILLING NAME
IT DOESN'T FEEL OR DISCRIMINATE
LIFE IS JUST A KILLING FIELD
IT'S ALL THAT'S LEFT - NOTHING'S REAL
THROW AWAY YOUR DISPOSABLE PAST
AND FALL APART LIKE A CIGARETTE ASH
WE ARE THE FATAL AND VITAL ONES OF THE WORLD
AND WE WILL BURN YOUR CITIES DOWN

Down...

WE WILL BURN YOUR CITIES DOWN

Feed the Hungry - Feed them shit
Feed them BONES and POLITICS
You wanna revolutionize?
Be specific and believe your eyes
Start a war in another backyard
And we'll destroy your house of cards
Give me a minute and I'll change your mind
Give me a bullet and I'll change your life

Remember / Surrender / The Time is Now
Continue / We're in you...
And we will BURN YOUR CITIES DOWN

AMERICA IS A KILLING NAME
IT DOESN'T FEEL OR DISCRIMINATE
LIFE IS JUST A KILLING FIELD

WE WILL BURN YOUR CITIES DOWN

America... what if "God" doesn't care?


3. Sulfur

My Guilt and My Shame always sell me short - always feel the same
And My Face and My Soul always wear me thin - always under control
But the longest hours you'll have in your life
Are the ones you sit through to know if you're right
So I'll wait, but I pray that I'm wrong
Because I think I know what's going on

So Let Me Get This Straight... the only will is my own
I do whatever I want and stay alone
All my decisions make it untouchable and tainted
I'm gonna suffer for the rest of my life
But I will always find a way to survive
I'm not a failure, but I know what it's like
I can take it or leave it... or die

STAY - You don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like Breathing in Sulfur...

My Life is undone - and I'm a sinner to most but a sage to some
And my Gods are Untrue - I'm probably wrong, but I'm better than you
And the longest hours I've had in my life
Were the ones I went through to know I was right
So I'm safe, but I'm a little outside
I'm gonna laugh when I'm buried alive

STAY - You don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like Breathing in Sulfur...

LIKE BREATHING IN SULFUR

STAY - You don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like Breathing in Sulfur...

LIKE BREATHING IN SULFUR


4. Psychosocial

I did my time and I want out
So effusive - Fade - It doesn't cut
The soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning - The sickening
Packaging subversion
Pseudo sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts - Go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in - getting smaller again
I'm Done! It has begun - I'm not the only one!

[Chorus:]
And the rain will kill us all...
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Psychosocial!

There are cracks in the road we laid
But where the devil fell
The secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had
Who needs another mess?
We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now theres only emptiness
Venomous, Insipid
I think we're done - I'm not the only one!

[Chorus]

THE LIMIT'S OF THE DEAD!

Fake Anti-Fascist lie - (Psychosocial!)
I tried to tell you but - (Psychosocial!)
Your purple hearts are giving out - (Psychosocial!)
Can't stop a killing idea - (Psychosocial!)
If it's hunting season - (Psychosocial!)
Is this what you want? - (Psychosocial!)
I'm not the only one!

[Chorus 2x]

The limits of the dead...


5. Dead Memories

Sitting in the dark, I can't forget.
Even now, I realize the time I'll never get.
Another story of the Bitter Pills of Fate.
I can't go back again. I can't go back again...
But you asked me to love you and I did.
Traded my emotions for a contract to commit

And when I got away, I only got so far. The Other Me Is Dead.
I hear his voice inside my head...
We were never alive, and we won't be born again.
But I'll never survive with Dead Memories in my heart.
You told me to love you and I did. Tied my soul into a knot and got me to submit.

So when I got away, I only kept my scars. The Other Me Is Gone.
Now I don't know where I belong...
We were never alive, and we won't be born again.
But I'll never survive with Dead Memories in my heart.
Dead Visions in your Name.
Dead Fingers in my Veins.
Dead Memories in my Heart


6. Vendetta

I know my uses / I have my pride / But my heart is still untamed
I learned my lessons / I've conquered Death / I go on and I'm unashamed
I'll paint your bones to match my eyes / They're the darkest I have ever seen
Until I'm lucid, I can't be told
I know my voices / They tell me to BELIEVE

Another fucking accident out of control / All the attitudes will never change
My Imitations are leading the way
I can't accept that I still don't find this strange

In light of my ability to feel denial
I walk away from everything with just a smile
The Agony of Coming Home has gone away
It's Everywhere / It's Everyone / It's Every Day

ARE YOU READY FOR THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE

I beg your pardon / I'm out of the way / A new conspiracy has taken my place
So over and over, I smell the decay
Believe what you want to - The Cycle Stays The Same

In light of my ability to undermine
I walk away from apathy - I'm feeling fine
The Agony of Cynicism beckons me
It's Everywhere / It's Everyone / It's Everything

ARE YOU READY FOR THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE

LET'S - PRETEND - WE'RE NOT AT THE END
PRETEND - THAT WE HAVE NOTHING LEFT

ARE YOU READY FOR THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE

LET'S - PRETEND - WE'RE NOT AT THE END
PRETEND - THAT WE HAVE NOTHING LEFT


7. Butcher's Hook

Contrite - Commercial - Arrogance - Leprosy
Consume The Bitch - The Fucker - Mindless - Like A Child
For Pity's Sake - I've Had All That I Can Take
We Try - But In The End We'll See
There Are No More Codes
Only Who Is Shit / And Who's Still Free
I was gonna change the world with Honor and Aggression
No one listened - no one cared
All they saw was misdirection

GO AHEAD AND DISAGREE / I'm giving up again...

I DON'T WANT YOU ANYMORE
I DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE
Fingerprint of God / Your new religions covet
This vessel wasn't built to last
But I will live forever/ you'll never have to say surrender
Because you're so part of it
My total honesty has no place for Tomorrow
Guilty pleasures give me pain
Tell my people I CAN'T FOLLOW

GO AHEAD AND DISAGREE / I'm giving up again...

You'll never CENSOR me / You'd better CHERISH me
My REASON has a voice / Freedom's gone but we'll always have a CHOICE
My PRESENT FUTURE TENSE / It doesn't make much SENSE
I'm coming after you / FUCK YOU ALL I'M THE ONLY POINT OF VIEW

Violence and Dollar Signs / Another processed piece of shit
You hide your fault in DIAMONDS and give away the only
COST - you can't delay the inevitable
LOST - don't understand the incredible path
I'm losing ground - but I won't care when I go down

GO AHEAD AND DISAGREE / I'm giving up again...

I'M GIVING UP AGAIN


8. Gehenna

Do you Believe? Do you Fade like a Dream?
Let me hear you BREATHE
Let me watch as you sleep
The Sparrow's Eyes... Promises shift into judgments
I cannot deny that you were designed for my punishments

The Blood and The Body - Control the cut so it's seamless
Show me your Heart - Show me the way to complete this
TETHERED / to a scene I / TREASURE / can you help me?
I / SEVER/ god it's perfect, it's / NEVER / really perfect
Now... I can finally be myself
Cuz I don't want to be myself

FREE MY SEVERED HEART, GIVE ME YOU - I WANT IT
(I don't want to be myself)

I cannot maintain a semblance of Normal anymore
I'd rather feel pain than try to fit in with you anymore
I'll throw it all away, like everybody else
I can finally be myself
Cuz I don't want to be myself

FREE MY SEVERED HEART, GIVE ME YOU - I WANT IT
(I don't want to be myself)


9. This Cold Black

Mother Nature is a Coward (Mother Nature is a Whore)
No More Presence / No More Power (I pray for death, by the hour)
Cut Another Smile Into Me (Into ME is All You Are)
My Artifice won't Recognize Me (You won't find me)... Anymore

Post-Traumatic War Machines / The Pessimists still won't believe
Throw away my past mistakes / It's all I can to feel
Let my weapons be you CHILDREN / Let my armies be your DAMNED
Try to suffer on in silence / TRY TO STOP ME IF YOU CAN

PNEUMATIC DESTROYER - PATHETIC SEDUCER
DISTORTION SUFFICIENT
SOME DAY - ONE DAY - WE'LL LIVE OUR LIVES AGAIN

My Ghosts Have Found Their Way Back Home
I have every right to kill my own
I am something now that never could exist
My Anguish Conquers All / Pay The Price And Watch Me Fall
My Only Key Is Broken - My Broken Key Is Only... ME

PNEUMATIC DESTROYER - PATHETIC SEDUCER
DISTORTION SUFFICIENT
SOME DAY - ONE DAY - WE'LL LIVE OUR LIVES AGAIN

You utter waste of tired flesh - It doesn't matter if you can't progress
Even now they still create me - Give me your ignorance / IRRITATE ME
I am made of the same debris - You want it all but you didn't want me
Hypocrite with no real use - I'm alive... what's your excuse?

PNEUMATIC DESTROYER - PATHETIC SEDUCER
DISTORTION SUFFICIENT
SOME DAY - ONE DAY - WE'LL LIVE OUR LIVES AGAIN
PNEUMATIC DESTROYER - PATHETIC SEDUCER
DISTORTION SUFFICIENT
SOME DAY - ONE DAY - WE'LL LIVE OUR LIVES AGAIN

WE'LL LIVE OUR LIVES AGAIN


10. Wherein Lies Continue

THOU SHALT NOT
Kill your Fathers - Destroy another Life
Question everything we clung to for years
Live Forever - Design a Better Death
Confuse a liar with a savior from fear
Create a Myth and Separate the Chosen Ones
Adolescent Independence / Dominion
I only wanna believe in fuckin' anything
But now my conscience is contradicting everything

THE ENDING'S THE SAME / THE WORLD WILL NOT CHANGE
THE ANSWER IS CLEAR...

Tell your Mothers they have no Sons or Daughters
Blame yourselves because your Children are Mine
We are Orphans, but we are not Forgotten
And we will find a way to save us this time
We can run, but we are tired of running
We're dropping seconds in a glass 'til we die
We only wanna believe in fuckin' everything
But we're alive and we're not accepting anything

THE ENDING'S THE SAME / THE WORLD WILL NOT CHANGE
THE ANSWER IS CLEAR... ANNIHILATION

I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm STRONGER BETTER
They gave to me now I give to you the means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm STRONGER BETTER MORE

WE HAVE TO SAVE OURSELVES

I will never become another piece
Inside the Paralytic Construct I hate
Live Forever? Well, I would rather die
At least I'd know I wasn't theirs to create
This is yours, but you had better choose
Before they take away your right to decide
I guess I'll never believe in fuckin' anything
But my solace is I CAN HANDLE EVERYTHING

THE ENDING'S THE SAME / THE WORLD WILL NOT CHANGE
THE ANSWER IS CLEAR... OBLITERATION

I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm STRONGER BETTER
They gave to me now I give to you the means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm STRONGER BETTER
I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm STRONGER BETTER
They gave to me now I give to you the means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm STRONGER BETTER
MORE

WE HAVE TO SAVE OURSELVES


11. Snuff

Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again...

So if you love me, let me go.
And run away before I know.
My heart is just too dark to care.
I can't destroy what isn't there.
Deliver me into my fate -
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you...
My smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light
But all of that was ripped apart...
when you refused to fight

So save your breath, I will not hear.
I think I made it very clear.
You couldn't hate enough to love.
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend.
Then I could hurt you in the end.
I never claimed to be a saint...
My own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away - you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control...
My love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know...


12. All Hope Is Gone

The state of the nation - violation!
A broken promise is as good as a lie.
The hell is humongous, the devil's among us
and we will burn because we won't unite!

What are we conceding for our freedom?
Why does anybody think we need 'em
I would rather fight,
than let another die.
We're the problem,
but we're also the solution.
ALL HOPE IS GONE!!!

If you want it come and take it from me.
If you think you can, you still don't know me.
Let me tell you, man, when I said it, I meant it
and I will always have the right to defend it.

Fifty seconds, a hundred murders.
The bill of rights is a bill of sale.
What will you do when the war is over?
What will you do when your system fails!?

We have made the present obsolete.
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way,
When all hope is gone!

We've seen the fall of the elite,
Bury your life, take your disease
We'll end the world,
When all hope is gone!

The wretched are the wounded,
The hungry starve to death,
In a place where no one goes,
The air itself is a final breath,
So discontinue, the anti-septic, care charade,
As a cry of justice comes,
A malignant fire fades.

I am the reason your future suffers,
I am the hatred you won't embrace
I am the worm of a pure gestation,
I am the remedy, spit in my face.
All your laws and rules are outdated,
All your subjects are killing the kings,
I can rattle off a million other reasons why,
But does it matter when the only thing we love will die?

We have made the present obsolete.
What do you want?
What do you need?
We'll find a way,
When all hope is gone!

We've seen the fall of the elite,
Bury your life, take your disease
We'll end the world,
When all hope is gone!
WHEN ALL HOPE IS GONE!!!

WHEN ALL HOPE IS GONE!!!

WHEN ALL HOPE IS GONE!!!


13. Child Of Burning Time

[Special Edition bonus track]

Child of burning time
The child of burning time

My only consolation is all lies
The apex of my consequence is dying here tonight
Winter has returned and it always looks like rain
I cant remember anything...anything
Inside the absolution is to come
And appetites are bittersweet I think I'm coming home
A chance to give up Avarice has marked my one regret
The child of burning time has gone, he hasn't come back, he hasn't come back yet

Before I tell my story please consider who I am
I missed my window years ago, I'm doing all I can
A tragedy is commonplace but in the end they go away
A skin is still the only stain I'm left to wear in shame
And I cut my need into my heart, I tear it all apart
I beg you burn me away, I won't become your hero just to fight the life I saved
Burn me away, I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today

I burn away
I burn away
I burn away
I burn away

My isolation is my course
The effect it has on life itself is a cancer on its source
I rue the moments spent between the fetish and the flame
Until this war is over I won't ever lose my rage

And I cut my need into my soul, I guess I'll never know
I beg you burn me away, I won't become your hero just to fight the life I saved
Burn me away, I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today

Burn me away, I wont become your hero just to fight the life I saved
Burn me away, I wont give up tomorrow just to lose it all, lose it all today


14. Vermilion Pt. 2 (Bloodstone Mix)

[Special Edition bonus track]

She seemed dressed in all of me
Stretched across my shame
All the torment and the pain
Leaked through and covered me
I'd do anything to have her to myself
Just to have her for myself
Now I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad

She is everything to me
The unrequited dream
A song that no one sings
The unattainable
She's a myth that I have to believe in
All I need to make it real is one more reason

I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad

But I won't let this build up inside of me

I catch in my throat
Choke
Torn into pieces
I won't - no
I don't wanna be this

But I won't let this build up inside of me

She isn't real
I can't make her real


15. Til We Die

[Special Edition bonus track]

My friends are all hurting from moments and regrets and charity laced with a lie
And still we keep hoping, to fix all the defects and strengthen these seminal ties
We go on together for better or worse, our history is to real to hate
Now and forever we stay until morning, and promise to fight for our fate

'Til we die
'Til we die

The start of the journey is every bit worth it, I can let you down anymore
The sky is still clearing, we're never afraid and the consequence opens the door
I've never stopped trying, I've never stopped feeling like family is much more than blood
Don't go on without me, the piece that I represent complements each and every one

'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've acheived has allowed us to win

'Til we die
'Til we die

My last true confession will open your eyes, I've never know trust like the nine
Let it be spoken, let it be screamed, they'll never ever take us alive

'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've acheived has allowed us to win

Carry on
Carry on

We'll never be broken, we won't be denied, our war is the pressure we need to deny
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied, our war is the pressure we need to deny

'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've acheived has allowed us to win

Carry on
Carry on

We'll never be broken, we won't be denied, our war is the pressure we need to deny

'Til we die
'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've acheived has allowed us to win
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied, our war is the pressure we need to deny

2. Unsainted

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I'll never kill myself to save my soul)
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I didn't come this far to sink so low)
I'm finally holding on to letting go

I'm just weathering a rough patch
Another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it
Pick a lord and you pray to it
You're so demanding when you want the truth
But your stories don't read for me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

Indecision overload
Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God
But did you think you'd shake your own?
This killing field is all grown over
The motherfucker wants it wild
Go sow your oats in alphabetical order
The anti-antagonist is back in style
Myopic, cannot see straight
Dystopic, one sin too late
You gotta lie if you wanna believe
But your bibles don't work on me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?
You've killed the saint in me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?


3. Birth Of The Cruel

(Let him crave understanding
Let him crave your wisdom
Let him crave
Let him... promote
Father... my self-control)

I'm just a Judas, looking for a silver line
And tomorrow is still a step behind
Hey hey drama, I'd love to be a waste of your time
Oh no, thanks so much for wasting mine
So hear me out

Let's hear it for the damaged
Who understands but the broken?
Developed in the arms of spite
I'm all fucked up and I make it look good
Adrenalin sight tonight

I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it

Sick, sickened, I'm sickening, I'm stricken by the fist
Blessed are the fires that have burned me
Listen to this, the lesson is, never underestimate the agony
Death of the fool, birth of the cruel

Remember how you spent the best part of forever in a state of pure disease
It was another thing altogether to forget that you brought out the worst in me
Hey Karma, you don't feel like I do
You just wish you'd hate like I do

We are the Bitter, the maladjusted and wise
Fighting off a generation too uptight
We're all dressed up with nobody to kill
The rhetoric stops tonight

I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it

Sick, sickened, I'm sickening, I'm stricken by the fist
Blessed are the fires that have burned me
Listen to this, the lesson is, never underestimate the agony
Death of the fool, birth of the...
Birth of the cruel!
Yeah!

Now's not the time for denying
Shifting the focus to scare
Let's not forget we're all guilty
All three dimensions polluted by earnest despair

I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it

(Let him crave understanding
Let him crave your wisdom
Let him crave
Let him... promote
Father... my self-control
That he can see and look at the enemy in front of him
And just goes, "Not today, sucker
Go back to Hell where you belong!")


4. Death Because Of Death

Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of you


5. Nero Forte

Watch this!

I'm never enough
You bleed me dry, using me up
Dissatisfied, and used
Another key to the empty spot in you
I'm sick as a fuck
I'm in my prime, what do you want?
I guess it's time, to see
If you're lost in hell you'll find no peace

Ooh, wade through hate and fear
I haven't felt like this in years
Not much left, so uprooted
Fists clenched tight in the pockets of my hoodie
And I know where I need to go
But the voice of reason can't say no
It's in the eyes, and heart
Just the latest psycho off the charts

That's what you do best!

A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

I know, and even if I didn't
I would lie so, many would believe it
Stand up and resist the chains
Of all the people in belligerent sick restraint
I wasn't enough
You bled me dry, which way is up?
Oh, you're a lie, and fake
I hope the truth is not too late

That's what you do best!

A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

That's what you do best!

That's what you do best...
That's what you do best... Hahahahahaha...

(WHY) Why was it easy for you?
(DID) Did I deserve the abuse?
(I) I can't believe I let it
(NOT) Not what I wanted
(SEE) See through your bullshit
(YOUR) You're so traumatic
(TRUE) True to your form of
(FACE) Every consequence
(UN) Unintimidated
(TIL) Till the very end
(IT) It'll never happen
(WAS) Was it all a lie?
(TOO) Many motherfuckers
(LATE) That's what you do best!
(LIE) That's what you do best!
(LIE) That's what you do best!

Oh, that's what you do best!

A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

A home like yours is upside down
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

That's what you do,
That's what you do best!
(What you, do best
What you, do best) Yeah!
(What you, do best
What you, do best
What you, do best
What you, do best)
That's what you do best!
That's what you do best!


6. Critical Darling

Yeah!

God's in a coma
Put Faith in a life support
Running away won't feel the same
If you reach a metaphysical last resort
Oh, malevolence and purgatory give you pause
It's a miracle you haven't broken any laws
We are not entitled to surviving
So keep your friends and your enemies thriving

(Good for you!) What a cliché...
(Just not true!) What a giveaway!
(What comes now!) Can't be the last one
Falling down!

Every time this happens I'm breaking a promise I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet and keep it away from the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

Once again, we got suffocated
In a sick perversion of a spider's web
Crawling over all the spent, digested pieces
Celebrate the dead
Here come all the judging eyes
Gotta pave the road with your best intentions
I only wish you could picture a future
That doesn't resemble your crazy inventions

(Good on you!) I don't mean it...
(Dream come true!) I don't need it!
(What goes up!) Another Hollow One
Must come down!

Every time this happens I'm breaking a promise I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet and keep it away from the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

A mirror only works if you open your eyes
But even then you have to understand what's inside
The easy part is always hardest to see
I know you'll never guess, but darling
You're so critical
Darling, you're so critical
Oh, you're so critical

Oh, this is a cave-in
The weight of the catalyst
Just wait, let the games begin
Gonna tell you all about it for the savages

(Good for you!) Not another one...
(Just not true!) Not another one!
(What comes now!) This world is
Falling down!

Every time this happens I'm breaking a promise I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet and keep it away from the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

It's begun!

Oh, you're so critical!
Yeah!
Oh, you're so critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!


7. A Liar's Funeral

The season at an end
A harvest of seclusion and regret
The burning can begin
A period of ash is what you get
The quiet is a curse
But my respect was shown to you by force
Another day too late
Another neck too eager for the rope

Liar
Liar

Yesterday was hard
Tomorrow is just a promise of the same
When friends have all subscribed
To spitting on the ground to say my name
Fire on the ice
December in the summer kills the heart
Your hate is no surprise
I guess I have to die to play my part

Liar
Liar

Ooh, close your eyes and join the blind
Slit your wrists for peace of mind
Turn your back and show us the truth
There's only one way to remember it for you

Burn, burn, burn, the liar
Burn, burn, burn, the liar
Burn, burn, burn, the liar
Burn, burn, burn, the liar

Hold the weight
Never trust the one beside you
Carried away
You know just as much as I do
Hold the weight
Do it all for what you really love
Carried away
Use you up until you've had enough

Hold the weight
Never trust the one beside you
Carried away
You know just as much as I do
Hold the weight
Do it all for what you really love
Carried away
Use you up until you've had enough

Clench your teeth and tighten your grip
Stand up straight, don't let it slip
Burn, burn, burn, the liar
Burn, burn, burn, the liar

True victims and survivors learn to make war
Don't wanna be the Sad Man Singing anymore
I did it all wrong so I'd get it all right
We're wasting all the candles, the dead need no light

Liar
Liar
Liar


8. Red Flag

Yeah!

Past just saving, this is like escaping
Running wild in the middle of weeds
Eyes can't see me, careful with your breathing
Get away or they get to feed
Strength's not enough, be defiant
You're looking for a reason to suffer, you'll find it
But if you want to live to be better, begin it
Your energy won't keep you from getting exhausted and purge it

You don't own me!
You can't hold me!
This is beginning!
You are an ending!

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

(Vultures, vultures, vultures, vultures
Vultures, vultures, vultures, vultures)

Vultures salivate poison to exterminate
It's the dawn of the Renaissance
Emancipation, cattle on displacement, you want
To reason but there is no response
I won't allow this to happen
Another situation I feel like I'm trapped in
Nothing is my business and business is gone
I wish you all could fuck off and go back to hell where you belong!

You don't own me!
You can't hold me!
This is beginning!
You are an ending!

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

Plague! (Plague!) Don't panic (Plague!)
Don't believe the riddle that confuses you
Bitch! (Bitch!) So manic (So manic!)
I can see the light that exposes you
So dramatic, now it's all emphatic means
The bigger the mouth that I can eat you with
Force of habit, God you reek of your havoc
But consider the sources you've been tampering with!

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

Now you're nothing!
Now you're nothing!
Now you're nothing new!
New!
Oh!
Yeah!


9. What's Next

[Instrumental]



10. Spiders

Well you can go it alone
Or keep it in between
The pages of the books you burn
So no one gets to read
The fingers pull your stitches tight
But knowing someone's secret is not enough
Everyone's a little bit a lot of the time

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

When now is not the time
Tomorrow disagrees
But your real world isn't ready to face
The face behind the real me
Time to think it over
I'm over trying to overthink, I've had enough, huh
Everybody's limited to what's on their mind

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

(Spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
(Spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)

Make yourself a martyr's pet
And watch them all escape (spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
Make yourself at home instead (spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
You'll lose your toxic waste (spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)

Go it alone
Suffer for your feelings, I'm not enough (no, no, no)
But everyone's a little bitter all of the time

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?


11. Orphan

I wept! When I realized
There were no more demons left to conquer
An opportunity to show my feelings
With skin so thick you'd swear it was armor
A penitentiary that only lets the oxygen out
I wasn't ready for a version of the truth to get out
I'm getting desperate, I wouldn't want to fester
In another bad dream, I am a man of extremes

I found the flesh and I'm liking it
I'll put an end to all your fucking psychobabble
We eat the meat 'cause the meat had a soul
We take their lives 'cause to hurt makes us whole

I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story, take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan, the one who kills your world

Keeping up appearances with acts of attrition
It doesn't matter 'cause I know you'll never listen
Before, you knew it when you saw it
Now you say you never knew it, it was all a big conspiracy
We come together when the hands of pain let go
Is there anybody left to fill this hole?
This shit will never wash off
Give yourself a medal, I swear I fucking give up

We're nothing special, just an accidental tweak of the freak
An evolution of the kennel in the fetish you seek
There's still the part of me that's dying in a dumpster
The one who rose is a motherfucking monster

I've seen the future, and it's simply burning!
I wasn't put here to be so discerning!
You want the world to be dissatisfied?!
You don't care, so why the fuck should I?
Fuck, should I sell myself to stay alive?

I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story, take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan, the one who kills...
The one who kills your world!

Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything

Tell me all about it
I'd love to hear it
The way I ruin everything I touch
I never thought I'd get to say I'm sorry
But then again I think you ask too much

Too white 2B black
Too black 2B blue
Too sick 2B me
Too fucked 2B you
I only wonder if I'll live to see the end of the road
It always gets me nowhere

I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story, take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan, the one who kills your world

Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
I am the orphan, the one who kills...
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
I am the orphan, the one who kills...

Yeah-hahahaha...


12. My Pain

Pain
She loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free to feel all of my pain

I'm your friend
And I'm your shade
Do what you want
Just remember it's for love

I'm your wall
And I'm your rock
Don't run away
Don't forget it's only love

I'm your chain
And I'm your lock
There's no escape
Just as long as I say... love

I'm your death
And I'm your cold
You end with me
Remember: this was never love
(Love, love, love, love)

I'll take this
(Love, love, love, love)
And I'll take that
(Love, love, love, love)
I'll take you too
(Love, love, love)
You can never give too much

Pain
She loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free
Pain

Pain
She loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free to feel all of my pain

I've always felt love this way for you


13. Not Long For This World

Cutting or scratching, they scar the same
The angle is off, the edges are soft, the mark remains
I know I'm bitter and full of rage
You would be too, what I've been through
Knowledge is a difficult age

So decide
Tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide
Tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see...
Not long for this world!

Carving or biting, we bleed for keeps
Out of control, into the cold, hell repeats
God, I'm starving, spreading me thin
Buying a story, my soul is for sale
Trust is such an arrogant thing

So decide
Tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide
Tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see...
Not long for this world!
Not long for this world!

I KNOW THE SHIT YOU EAT
There's nothing mellow in the
DRAMA YOU LIVE AND BREATHE
You like your secrets to be
KEPT IN THE FAMILY
You don't get credit for your
RARE GOOD BEHAVIOR, GO BE A SAVIOR
You don't seem to get what I'm saying...
And I'm sick and tired of explaining!
GOODNIGHT, GOODBYE, GOOD LUCK
There's nothing worse than a
GHOUL MANIFESTO, I'M NOT IMPRESSED THOUGH

The greatest conclusion that I ever had
Was when I woke up and said, "That's enough!"
Living never felt so bad
You don't accept it, and I don't care
Bury yourself above all your guilt
When you're ready it'll be there

So decide
Tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide
Tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see...
Not long for this world!
Not long for this world!
Not long for this world!

I was not long for this world...
I was not long for this world...

I was not long for this world!
I was not long for this world!
I was not long for this world!
I was not long for this world!


14. Solway Firth

Today, up on this hill, I'm counting all the killers
They sway as they swarm, a look of gluttons in their eyes
They mutter as the body loses warmth
They pick your bones like locks inside a tomb
And take great care to not take care of you
Here's an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one

While I was learning to live, we all were living a lie
I guess you got what you wanted
So I will settle for a slaughterhouse soaked in blood and betrayal
It's always somebody else, somebody else was me
You want the real smile?
Or the one I used to practice not to feel like a failure?

I don't need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don't need you to hide it from me
I just want to feel like any other man
I won't show you the whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away

Here's an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one

I'm not ahead of my time, I just drew the first breath
If I'm alive tomorrow
I will alleviate the pressure by cutting you out of me
I found my bottom line dead on the front lines
I know I'll never go home
So set fire to your ships and past regrets and be free

I don't need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don't need you to hide it from me
I just want to feel like any other man
I won't show you my whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away

Here's an unexplainable one
What have you done?
What have you done?
Yeah

Oh, while I was learning to live, you taught me how to die
I guess I got what I wanted
Another needle in the back through purified scarification
It wasn't somebody else, you fucking did it to me
You want a real smile?
I haven't smiled in years


15. All Out Life

[Japanese Bonus Track]

What a world, the horizon's
Coming like a hell-bent killing machine
Can't afford to be the goddamn wreckage
Burn it all again at a million degrees
Calling all the adamant upper-level
Undefeated counterfeit cunts with a reason to fear
Throw away all the meaningless shit that's clinging
The enemy is here, I said stop

Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
One by one against, give me the name
All you shiny pretty never-wills ruined the game
You hold all the keys, so the chains shouldn't hold you
I know you heard me, I fucking told you

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
No excuses, I challenge you to all out fucking life

Drop that shit and put it on a pedestal
Children are afraid of the gods
Raise your hands and show me what's impossible
That makes us even, never tell me the odds
What a bore, I'm getting stuck in a metaphor
I don't wanna go to sleep
I need a breakdown quick in negotiations
Get it all together and remember to seethe, stop

Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
Drive by violence, more of the same
I can see where you're going, and I'm really ashamed
Do you think when you act or just act like you're thinking?
I gotta know now, you better tell me

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
I challenge you to all out life

We are gathered here today to get it right
Repeat after me:
"I will not celebrate mediocrity
I will not worship empty shells
I will not listen to worthless noises
I will not subject myself to selected predictable choices
My time, my attention
My quality should not be bought and sold
For convenience's sake, ever"

We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
Pay attention, it's gonna be a while 'til I really feel alright
Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
No excuses, I challenge you to all out fucking life

All out life, yeah
I challenge you to all out fucking life, yeah
Live, live, live, life
