Dhd Gr Now and then his attention wandered from the book and the Square and he formed in imagination a new plan of life. On the previous evening at the Lodge, he had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the Emperor and that it would be wiser for him to leave Petersburg. Pierre proposed going to his estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs. He was joyfully planning this new life, when Prince VasÃ­li suddenly entered the room.

â€œMy dear fellow, what have you been up to in Moscow? Why have you quarreled with HÃ©lÃ¨ne, mon cher? You are under a delusion,â€ said Prince VasÃ­li, as he entered. â€œI know all about it, and I can tell you positively that HÃ©lÃ¨ne is as innocent before you as Christ was before the Jews.â€

Pierre was about to reply, but Prince VasÃ­li interrupted him.

â€œAnd why didnâ€™t you simply come straight to me as to a friend? I know all about it and understand it all,â€ he said. â€œYou behaved as becomes a man who values his honor, perhaps too hastily, but we w&j² BX opened the door for him.

â€œGo!â€ he repeated, amazed at himself and glad to see the look of confusion and fear that showed itself on Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s face.

â€œWhatâ€™s the matter with you? Are you ill?â€

â€œGo!â€ the quivering voice repeated. And Prince VasÃ­li had to go without receiving any explanation.

A week later, Pierre, having taken leave of his new friends, the Masons, and leaving large sums of money with them for alms, went away to his estates. His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity.

CHAPTER VI
The duel between Pierre and DÃ³lokhov was hushed up and, in spite of the Emperorâ€™s severity regarding duels at that time, neither the principals nor their seconds suffered for it. But the story of the duel, confirmed by Pierreâ€™s rupture with his wife, was the talk of society. Pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an illegitimate son, and petted and extolled when he was the best match in Russia, had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his marriageâ€”when the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing to hope from himâ€”especially as he did not know how, and did not wish, to court societyâ€™s favor. Now he alone was blamed for what had happened, he was said to be insanely jealous and subject like his father to fits of bloodthirsty rage. And when after Pierreâ€™s departure HÃ©lÃ¨ne returned to Petersburg, she was received by all her acquaintances not only cordially, but even with a shade of deference due to her misfortune. When conversation turned on her husband HÃ©lÃ¨ne assumed a dignified expression, which with characteristic tact she had acquired though she did not understand its significance. This expression suggested that she had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly and that her husband was a cross laid upon her by God. Prince VasÃ­li expressed his opinion more openly. He shrugged his shoulders when Pierre was mentioned and, pointing to his forehead, remarked:

â€œA bit touchedâ€”I always said so.â€

â€œI said from the first,â€ declared Anna PÃ¡vlovna referring to Pierre, â€œI said at the time and before anyone elseâ€ (she insisted on her priority) â€œthat that senseless young man was spoiled by the depraved ideas of these days. I said so even at the time when everybody was in raptures about him, when he had just returned from abroad, and when, if you remember, he posed as a sort of Marat at one of my soirees. And how has it ended? I was against this marriage even then and foretold all that has happened.â€

Anna PÃ¡vlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of soirees as beforeâ€”such as she alone had the gift of arrangingâ€”at which was to be found â€œthe cream of really good society, the bloom of the intellectual essence of Petersburg,â€ as she herself put it. Besides this refined selection of society Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s receptions were also distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new and interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the state of the political thermometer of legitimate Petersburg court society so dearly and distinctly indicated.

Toward the end of 1806, when all the sad details of Napoleonâ€™s destruction of the Prussian army at Jena and AuerstÃ¤dt and the surrender of most of the Prussian fortresses had been received, when our troops had already entered Prussia and our second war with Napoleon was beginning, Anna PÃ¡vlovna gave one of her soirees. The â€œcream of really good societyâ€ consisted of the fascinating HÃ©lÃ¨ne, forsaken by her husband, Mortemart, the delightful Prince Hippolyte who had just returned from Vienna, two diplomatists, the old aunt, a young man referred to in that drawing room as â€œa man of great meritâ€ (un homme de beaucoup de mÃ©rite), a newly appointed maid of honor and her mother, and several other less noteworthy persons.

The novelty Anna PÃ¡vlovna was setting before her guests that evening was BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³y, who had just arrived as a special messenger from the Prussian army and was aide-de-camp to a very important personage.

The temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that evening was this:

â€œWhatever the European sovereigns and commanders may do to countenance Bonaparte, and to cause me, and us in general, annoyance and mortification, our opinion of Bonaparte cannot alter. We shall not cease to express our sincere views on that subject, and can only say to the King of Prussia and others: â€˜So much the worse for you. Tu lâ€™as voulu, George Dandin,â€™ thatâ€™s all we have to say about it!â€

When BorÃ­s, who was to be served up to the guests, entered the drawing room, almost all the company had assembled, and the conversation, guided by Anna PÃ¡vlovna, was about our diplomatic relations with Austria and the hope of an alliance with her.

BorÃ­s, grown more manly and looking fresh, rosy and self-possessed, entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an aide-de-camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and then brought back to the general circle.

Anna PÃ¡vlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to several persons whom he did not know, giving him a whispered description of each.

â€œPrince Hippolyte KurÃ¡ginâ€”charming young fellow; M. Kronq,â€”chargÃ© dâ€™affaires from Copenhagenâ€”a profound intellect,â€ and simply, â€œMr. ShÃ­tovâ€”a man of great meritâ€â€”this of the man usually so described.

Thanks to Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâ€™s efforts, his own tastes, and the peculiarities of his reserved nature, BorÃ­s had managed during his service to place himself very advantageously. He was aide-de-camp to a very important personage, had been sent on a very important mission to Prussia, and had just returned from there as a special messenger. He had become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had been so pleased at OlmÃ¼tz and according to which an ensign might rank incomparably higher than a general, and according to which what was needed for success in the service was not effort or work, or courage, or perseverance, but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can grant rewards, and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his success and at the inability of others to understand these things. In consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life, all his relations with old friends, all his plans for his future, were completely altered. He was not rich, but would spend his last groat to be better dressed than others, and would rather deprive himself of many pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear in the streets of Petersburg in an old uniform. He made friends with and sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and who could therefore be of use to him. He liked Petersburg and despised Moscow. The remembrance of the RostÃ³vsâ€™ house and of his childish love for NatÃ¡sha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see the RostÃ³vs since the day of his departure for the army. To be in Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s drawing room he considered an important step up in the service, and he at once understood his role, letting his hostess make use of whatever interest he had to offer. He himself carefully scanned each face, appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy with each of those present, and the advantages that might accrue. He took the seat indicated to him beside the fair HÃ©lÃ¨ne and listened to the general conversation.

â€œVienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable that not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure them, and she doubts the means we have of gaining them. That is the actual phrase used by the Vienna cabinet,â€ said the Danish chargÃ© dâ€™affaires.

â€œThe doubt is flattering,â€ said â€œthe man of profound intellect,â€ with a subtle smile.

â€œWe must distinguish between the Vienna cabinet and the Emperor of Austria,â€ said Mortemart. â€œThe Emperor of Austria can never have thought of such a thing, it is only the cabinet that says it.â€

â€œAh, my dear vicomte,â€ put in Anna PÃ¡vlovna, â€œLâ€™Uropeâ€ (for some reason she called it Urope as if that were a specially refined French pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with a Frenchman), â€œLâ€™Urope ne sera jamais notre alliÃ©e sincÃ¨re.â€ *

* â€œEurope will never be our sincere ally.â€

After that Anna PÃ¡vlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the King of Prussia, in order to draw BorÃ­s into the conversation.

BorÃ­s listened attentively to each of the speakers, awaiting his turn, but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor, the beautiful HÃ©lÃ¨ne, whose eyes several times met those of the handsome young aide-de-camp with a smile.

Speaking of the position of Prussia, Anna PÃ¡vlovna very naturally asked BorÃ­s to tell them about his journey to Glogau and in what state he found the Prussian army. BorÃ­s, speaking with deliberation, told them in pure, correct French many interesting details about the armies and the court, carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his own about the facts he was recounting. For some time he engrossed the general attention, and Anna PÃ¡vlovna felt that the novelty she had served up was received with pleasure by all her visitors. The greatest attention of all to BorÃ­sâ€™ narrative was shown by HÃ©lÃ¨ne. She asked him several questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested in the state of the Prussian army. As soon as he had finished she turned to him with her usual smile.

â€œYou absolutely must come and see me,â€ she said in a tone that implied that, for certain considerations he could not know of, this was absolutely necessary.

â€œOn Tuesday between eight and nine. It will give me great pleasure.â€

BorÃ­s promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a conversation with her, when Anna PÃ¡vlovna called him away on the pretext that her aunt wished to hear him.

â€œYou know her husband, of course?â€ said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, closing her eyes and indicating HÃ©lÃ¨ne with a sorrowful gesture. â€œAh, she is such an unfortunate and charming woman! Donâ€™t mention him before herâ€”please donâ€™t! It is too painful for her!â€

CHAPTER VII
When BorÃ­s and Anna PÃ¡vlovna returned to the others Prince Hippolyte had the ear of the company.

Bending forward in his armchair he said: â€œLe Roi de Prusse!â€ and having said this laughed. Everyone turned toward him.

â€œLe Roi de Prusse?â€ Hippolyte said interrogatively, again laughing, and then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair. Anna PÃ¡vlovna waited for him to go on, but as he seemed quite decided to say no more she began to tell of how at Potsdam the impious Bonaparte had stolen the sword of Frederick the Great.

â€œIt is the sword of Frederick the Great which I...â€ she began, but Hippolyte interrupted her with the words: â€œLe Roi de Prusse...â€ and again, as soon as all turned toward him, excused himself and said no more.

Anna PÃ¡vlovna frowned. Mortemart, Hippolyteâ€™s friend, addressed him firmly.

â€œCome now, what about your Roi de Prusse?â€

Hippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing.

â€œOh, itâ€™s nothing. I only wished to say...â€ (he wanted to repeat a joke he had heard in Vienna and which he had been trying all that evening to get in) â€œI only wished to say that we are wrong to fight pour le Roi de Prusse!â€

BorÃ­s smiled circumspectly, so that it might be taken as ironical or appreciative according to the way the joke was received. Everybody laughed.

â€œYour joke is too bad, itâ€™s witty but unjust,â€ said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, shaking her little shriveled finger at him.

â€œWe are not fighting pour le Roi de Prusse, but for right principles. Oh, that wicked Prince Hippolyte!â€ she said.

The conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the political news. It became particularly animated toward the end of the evening when the rewards bestowed by the Emperor were mentioned.

â€œYou know Nâ€” Nâ€” received a snuffbox with the portrait last year?â€ said â€œthe man of profound intellect.â€ â€œWhy shouldnâ€™t Sâ€” Sâ€” get the same distinction?â€

â€œPardon me! A snuffbox with the Emperorâ€™s portrait is a reward but not a distinction,â€ said the diplomatistâ€”â€œa gift, rather.â€

â€œThere are precedents, I may mention Schwarzenberg.â€

â€œItâ€™s impossible,â€ replied another.

â€œWill you bet? The ribbon of the order is a different matter....â€

When everybody rose to go, HÃ©lÃ¨ne who had spoken very little all the evening again turned to BorÃ­s, asking him in a tone of caressing significant command to come to her on Tuesday.

â€œIt is of great importance to me,â€ she said, turning with a smile toward Anna PÃ¡vlovna, and Anna PÃ¡vlovna, with the same sad smile with which she spoke of her exalted patroness, supported HÃ©lÃ¨neâ€™s wish.

It seemed as if from some words BorÃ­s had spoken that evening about the Prussian army, HÃ©lÃ¨ne had suddenly found it necessary to see him. She seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came on Tuesday.

But on Tuesday evening, having come to HÃ©lÃ¨neâ€™s splendid salon, BorÃ­s received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to come. There were other guests and the countess talked little to him, and only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly and in a whisper, with a strangely unsmiling face: â€œCome to dinner tomorrow... in the evening. You must come.... Come!â€

During that stay in Petersburg, BorÃ­s became an intimate in the countessâ€™ house.

CHAPTER VIII
The war was flaming up and nearing the Russian frontier. Everywhere one heard curses on Bonaparte, â€œthe enemy of mankind.â€ Militiamen and recruits were being enrolled in the villages, and from the seat of war came contradictory news, false as usual and therefore variously interpreted. The life of old Prince BolkÃ³nski, Prince Andrew, and Princess Mary had greatly changed since 1805.

In 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief then appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout Russia. Despite the weakness of age, which had become particularly noticeable since the time when he thought his son had been killed, he did not think it right to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the Emperor himself, and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy and strength. He was continually traveling through the three provinces entrusted to him, was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties, severe to cruel with his subordinates, and went into everything down to the minutest details himself. Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in mathematics from her father, and when the old prince was at home went to his study with the wet nurse and little Prince Nicholas (as his grandfather called him). The baby Prince Nicholas lived with his wet nurse and nurse SÃ¡vishna in the late princessâ€™ rooms and Princess Mary spent most of the day in the nursery, taking a motherâ€™s place to her little nephew as best she could. Mademoiselle Bourienne, too, seemed passionately fond of the boy, and Princess Mary often deprived herself to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angelâ€”as she called her nephewâ€”and playing with him.

Near the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the tomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a marble monument brought from Italy, representing an angel with outspread wings ready to fly upwards. The angelâ€™s upper lip was slightly raised as though about to smile, and once on coming out of the chapel Prince Andrew and Princess Mary admitted to one another that the angelâ€™s face reminded them strangely of the little princess. But what was still stranger, though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister, was that in the expression the sculptor had happened to give the angelâ€™s face, Prince Andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead wife: â€œAh, why have you done this to me?â€

Soon after Prince Andrewâ€™s return the old prince made over to him a large estate, BoguchÃ¡rovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald Hills. Partly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills, partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with his fatherâ€™s peculiarities, and partly because he needed solitude, Prince Andrew made use of BoguchÃ¡rovo, began building and spent most of his time there.

After the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not to continue his military service, and when the war recommenced and everybody had to serve, he took a post under his father in the recruitment so as to avoid active service. The old prince and his son seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805. The old man, roused by activity, expected the best results from the new campaign, while Prince Andrew on the contrary, taking no part in the war and secretly regretting this, saw only the dark side.

On February 26, 1807, the old prince set off on one of his circuits. Prince Andrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during his fatherâ€™s absence. Little Nicholas had been unwell for four days. The coachman who had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters for Prince Andrew.

Not finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the letters to Princess Maryâ€™s apartments, but did not find him there. He was told that the prince had gone to the nursery.

â€œIf you please, your excellency, PÃ©trusha has brought some papers,â€ said one of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting on a childâ€™s little chair while, frowning and with trembling hands, he poured drops from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water.

â€œWhat is it?â€ he said crossly, and, his hand shaking unintentionally, he poured too many drops into the glass. He threw the mixture onto the floor and asked for some more water. The maid brought it.

There were in the room a childâ€™s cot, two boxes, two armchairs, a table, a childâ€™s table, and the little chair on which Prince Andrew was sitting. The curtains were drawn, and a single candle was burning on the table, screened by a bound music book so that the light did not fall on the cot.

â€œMy dear,â€ said Princess Mary, addressing her brother from beside the cot where she was standing, â€œbetter wait a bit... later...â€

â€œOh, leave off, you always talk nonsense and keep putting things offâ€”and this is what comes of it!â€ said Prince Andrew in an exasperated whisper, evidently meaning to wound his sister.

â€œMy dear, really... itâ€™s better not to wake him... heâ€™s asleep,â€ said the princess in a tone of entreaty.

Prince Andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed, wineglass in hand.

â€œPerhaps weâ€™d really better not wake him,â€ he said hesitating.

â€œAs you please... really... I think so... but as you please,â€ said Princess Mary, evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion had prevailed. She drew her brotherâ€™s attention to the maid who was calling him in a whisper.

It was the second night that neither of them had slept, watching the boy who was in a high fever. These last days, mistrusting their household doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town, they had been trying first one remedy and then another. Worn out by sleeplessness and anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one another and reproached and disputed with each other.

â€œPÃ©trusha has come with papers from your father,â€ whispered the maid.

Prince Andrew went out.

â€œDevil take them!â€ he muttered, and after listening to the verbal instructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his fatherâ€™s letter, he returned to the nursery.

â€œWell?â€ he asked.

â€œStill the same. Wait, for heavenâ€™s sake. Karl IvÃ¡nich always says that sleep is more important than anything,â€ whispered Princess Mary with a sigh.

Prince Andrew went up to the child and felt him. He was burning hot.

â€œConfound you and your Karl IvÃ¡nich!â€ He took the glass with the drops and again went up to the cot.

â€œAndrew, donâ€™t!â€ said Princess Mary.

But he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyes, and stooped glass in hand over the infant.

â€œBut I wish it,â€ he said. â€œI beg youâ€”give it him!â€

Princess Mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively and calling the nurse began giving the medicine. The child screamed hoarsely. Prince Andrew winced and, clutching his head, went out and sat down on a sofa in the next room.

He still had all the letters in his hand. Opening them mechanically he began reading. The old prince, now and then using abbreviations, wrote in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows:

Have just this moment received by special messenger very joyful newsâ€”if itâ€™s not false. Bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete victory over Buonaparte at Eylau. In Petersburg everyone is rejoicing, and the rewards sent to the army are innumerable. Though he is a Germanâ€”I congratulate him! I canâ€™t make out what the commander at KÃ³rchevoâ€”a certain KhandrikÃ³vâ€”is up to; till now the additional men and provisions have not arrived. Gallop off to him at once and say Iâ€™ll have his head off if everything is not here in a week. Have received another letter about the Preussisch-Eylau battle from PÃ©tenkaâ€”he took part in itâ€”and itâ€™s all true. When mischief-makers donâ€™t meddle even a German beats Buonaparte. He is said to be fleeing in great disorder. Mind you gallop off to KÃ³rchevo without delay and carry out instructions!

Prince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope. It was a closely written letter of two sheets from BilÃ­bin. He folded it up without reading it and reread his fatherâ€™s letter, ending with the words: â€œGallop off to KÃ³rchevo and carry out instructions!â€

â€œNo, pardon me, I wonâ€™t go now till the child is better,â€ thought he, going to the door and looking into the nursery.

Princess Mary was still standing by the cot, gently rocking the baby.

â€œAh yes, and what else did he say thatâ€™s unpleasant?â€ thought Prince Andrew, recalling his fatherâ€™s letter. â€œYes, we have gained a victory over Bonaparte, just when Iâ€™m not serving. Yes, yes, heâ€™s always poking fun at me.... Ah, well! Let him!â€ And he began reading BilÃ­binâ€™s letter which was written in French. He read without understanding half of it, read only to forget, if but for a moment, what he had too long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all else.

CHAPTER IX
BilÃ­bin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity, and though he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms, he described the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure and self-derision genuinely Russian. BilÃ­bin wrote that the obligation of diplomatic discretion tormented him, and he was happy to have in Prince Andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army. The letter was old, having been written before the battle at Preussisch-Eylau.

â€œSince the day of our brilliant success at Austerlitz,â€ wrote BilÃ­bin, â€œas you know, my dear prince, I never leave headquarters. I have certainly acquired a taste for war, and it is just as well for me; what I have seen during these last three months is incredible.

â€œI begin ab ovo. â€˜The enemy of the human race,â€™ as you know, attacks the Prussians. The Prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed us three times in three years. We take up their cause, but it turns out that â€˜the enemy of the human raceâ€™ pays no heed to our fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the Prussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had begun, and in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in the palace at Potsdam.

â€œâ€˜I most ardently desire,â€™ writes the King of Prussia to Bonaparte, â€˜that Your Majesty should be received and treated in my palace in a manner agreeable to yourself, and in so far as circumstances allowed, I have hastened to take all steps to that end. May I have succeeded!â€™ The Prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to the French and lay down their arms at the first demand.

â€œThe head of the garrison at Glogau, with ten thousand men, asks the King of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender.... All this is absolutely true.

â€œIn short, hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude, it turns out that we have landed ourselves in war, and what is more, in war on our own frontiers, with and for the King of Prussia. We have everything in perfect order, only one little thing is lacking, namely, a commander in chief. As it was considered that the Austerlitz success might have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so young, all our octogenarians were reviewed, and of ProzorÃ³vski and KÃ¡menski the latter was preferred. The general comes to us, SuvÃ³rov-like, in a kibÃ­tka, and is received with acclamations of joy and triumph.

â€œOn the 4th, the first courier arrives from Petersburg. The mails are taken to the field marshalâ€™s room, for he likes to do everything himself. I am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant for us. The field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed to him. We search, but none are to be found. The field marshal grows impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the Emperor to Count T., Prince V., and others. Then he bursts into one of his wild furies and rages at everyone and everything, seizes the letters, opens them, and reads those from the Emperor addressed to others. â€˜Ah! So thatâ€™s the way they treat me! No confidence in me! Ah, ordered to keep an eye on me! Very well then! Get along with you!â€™ So he writes the famous order of the day to General Bennigsen:

â€œâ€˜I am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the army. You have brought your army corps to PultÃºsk, routed: here it is exposed, and without fuel or forage, so something must be done, and, as you yourself reported to Count BuxhÃ¶wden yesterday, you must think of retreating to our frontierâ€”which do today.â€™

â€œâ€˜From all my riding,â€™ he writes to the Emperor, â€˜I have got a saddle sore which, coming after all my previous journeys, quite prevents my riding and commanding so vast an army, so I have passed on the command to the general next in seniority, Count BuxhÃ¶wden, having sent him my whole staff and all that belongs to it, advising him if there is a lack of bread, to move farther into the interior of Prussia, for only one dayâ€™s ration of bread remains, and in some regiments none at all, as reported by the division commanders, Ostermann and SedmorÃ©tzki, and all that the peasants had has been eaten up. I myself will remain in hospital at Ostrolenka till I recover. In regard to which I humbly submit my report, with the information that if the army remains in its present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left in it by spring.

â€œâ€˜Grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is already in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and glorious task for which he was chosen. I shall await your most gracious permission here in hospital, that I may not have to play the part of a secretary rather than commander in the army. My removal from the army does not produce the slightest stirâ€”a blind man has left it. There are thousands such as I in Russia.â€™

â€œThe field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all, isnâ€™t it logical?

â€œThis is the first act. Those that follow are naturally increasingly interesting and entertaining. After the field marshalâ€™s departure it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle. BuxhÃ¶wden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen does not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fight a battle â€˜on his own handâ€™ as the Germans say. He does so. This is the battle of PultÃºsk, which is considered a great victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according to that it is we who lost the battle of PultÃºsk. In short, we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up the command of the army to General BuxhÃ¶wden. During this interregnum we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers. Our aim is no longer, as it should be, to avoid or attack the enemy, but solely to avoid General BuxhÃ¶wden who by right of seniority should be our chief. So energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy, who at the moment is not Bonaparte but BuxhÃ¶wden. General BuxhÃ¶wden was all but attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him. BuxhÃ¶wden pursues usâ€”we scuttle. He hardly crosses the river to our side before we recross to the other. At last our enemy, BuxhÃ¶wden, catches us and attacks. Both generals are angry, and the result is a challenge on BuxhÃ¶wdenâ€™s part and an epileptic fit on Bennigsenâ€™s. But at the critical moment the courier who carried the news of our victory at PultÃºsk to Petersburg returns bringing our appointment as commander in chief, and our first foe, BuxhÃ¶wden, is vanquished; we can now turn our thoughts to the second, Bonaparte. But as it turns out, just at that moment a third enemy rises before usâ€”namely the Orthodox Russian soldiers, loudly demanding bread, meat, biscuits, fodder, and whatnot! The stores are empty, the roads impassable. The Orthodox begin looting, and in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea. Half the regiments form bands and scour the countryside and put everything to fire and sword. The inhabitants are totally ruined, the hospitals overflow with sick, and famine is everywhere. Twice the marauders even attack our headquarters, and the commander in chief has to ask for a battalion to disperse them. During one of these attacks they carried off my empty portmanteau and my dressing gown. The Emperor proposes to give all commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders, but I much fear this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other.â€

At first Prince Andrew read with his eyes only, but after a while, in spite of himself (although he knew how far it was safe to trust BilÃ­bin), what he had read began to interest him more and more. When he had read thus far, he crumpled the letter up and threw it away. It was not what he had read that vexed him, but the fact that the life out there in which he had now no part could perturb him. He shut his eyes, rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he had read, and listened to what was passing in the nursery. Suddenly he thought he heard a strange noise through the door. He was seized with alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was reading the letter. He went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it.

Just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him with a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the cot.

â€œMy dear,â€ he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind him.

As often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety, he was seized by an unreasoning panicâ€”it occurred to him that the child was dead. All that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror.

â€œAll is over,â€ he thought, and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He went to the cot in confusion, sure that he would find it empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby. He drew the curtain aside and for some time his frightened, restless eyes could not find the baby. At last he saw him: the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow, and was smacking his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly.

Prince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that, as if he had already lost him. He bent over him and, as his sister had taught him, tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish. The soft forehead was moist. Prince Andrew touched the head with his hand; even the hair was wet, so profusely had the child perspired. He was not dead, but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent. Prince Andrew longed to snatch up, to squeeze, to hold to his heart, this helpless little creature, but dared not do so. He stood over him, gazing at his head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket. He heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of the cot. He did not look round, but still gazing at the infantâ€™s face listened to his regular breathing. The dark shadow was Princess Mary, who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps, lifted the curtain, and dropped it again behind her. Prince Andrew recognized her without looking and held out his hand to her. She pressed it.

â€œHe has perspired,â€ said Prince Andrew.

â€œI was coming to tell you so.â€

The child moved slightly in his sleep, smiled, and rubbed his forehead against the pillow.

Prince Andrew looked at his sister. In the dim shadow of the curtain her luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that were in them. She leaned over to her brother and kissed him, slightly catching the curtain of the cot. Each made the other a warning gesture and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the world. Prince Andrew was the first to move away, ruffling his hair against the muslin of the curtain.

â€œYes, this is the one thing left me now,â€ he said with a sigh.

CHAPTER X
Soon after his admission to the Masonic Brotherhood, Pierre went to the Kiev province, where he had the greatest number of serfs, taking with him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to what he should do on his estates.

When he reached Kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office and explained to them his intentions and wishes. He told them that steps would be taken immediately to free his serfsâ€”and that till then they were not to be overburdened with labor, women while nursing their babies were not to be sent to work, assistance was to be given to the serfs, punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal, and hospitals, asylums, and schools were to be established on all the estates. Some of the stewards (there were semiliterate foremen among them) listened with alarm, supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased with their management and embezzlement of money, some after their first fright were amused by Pierreâ€™s lisp and the new words they had not heard before, others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked, while the cleverest among them, including the chief steward, understood from this speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends.

The chief steward expressed great sympathy with Pierreâ€™s intentions, but remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into the general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory.

Despite Count BezÃºkhovâ€™s enormous wealth, since he had come into an income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year, Pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him an allowance of ten thousand rubles. He had a dim perception of the following budget:

About 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank, about 30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow, the town house, and the allowance to the three princesses; about 15,000 was given in pensions and the same amount for asylums; 150,000 alimony was sent to the countess; about 70,000 went for interest on debts. The building of a new church, previously begun, had cost about 10,000 in each of the last two years, and he did not know how the rest, about 100,000 rubles, was spent, and almost every year he was obliged to borrow. Besides this the chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests, or of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops. So the first task Pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or inclinationâ€”practical business.

He discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward. But he felt that this did not forward matters at all. He felt that these consultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with them or make them move. On the one hand, the chief steward put the state of things to him in the very worst light, pointing out the necessity of paying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor, to which Pierre did not agree. On the other hand, Pierre demanded that steps should be taken to liberate the serfs, which the steward met by showing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the Land Bank, and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation.

The steward did not say it was quite impossible, but suggested selling the forests in the province of KostromÃ¡, the land lower down the river, and the Crimean estate, in order to make it possible: all of which operations according to him were connected with such complicated measuresâ€”the removal of injunctions, petitions, permits, and so onâ€”that Pierre became quite bewildered and only replied:

â€œYes, yes, do so.â€

Pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it. The steward for his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these consultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to himself.

In Kiev Pierre found some people he knew, and strangers hastened to make his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer, the largest landowner of the province. Temptations to Pierreâ€™s greatest weaknessâ€”the one to which he had confessed when admitted to the Lodgeâ€”were so strong that he could not resist them. Again whole days, weeks, and months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much occupied with evening parties, dinners, lunches, and balls, giving him no time for reflection, as in Petersburg. Instead of the new life he had hoped to lead he still lived the old life, only in new surroundings.

Of the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not fulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral life, and that of the seven virtues he lacked twoâ€”morality and the love of death. He consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled another of the preceptsâ€”that of reforming the human raceâ€”and had other virtuesâ€”love of his neighbor, and especially generosity.

In the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg. On the way he intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom God had entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit.

The chief steward, who considered the young countâ€™s attempts almost insaneâ€”unprofitable to himself, to the count, and to the serfsâ€”made some concessions. Continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs as impracticable, he arranged for the erection of large buildingsâ€”schools, hospitals, and asylumsâ€”on all the estates before the master arrived. Everywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes (which he knew Pierre would not like), but for just such gratefully religious ones, with offerings of icons and the bread and salt of hospitality, as, according to his understanding of his master, would touch and delude him.

The southern spring, the comfortable rapid traveling in a Vienna carriage, and the solitude of the road, all had a gladdening effect on Pierre. The estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque than the other; the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly grateful for the benefits conferred on them. Everywhere were receptions, which though they embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the depth of his heart. In one place the peasants presented him with bread and salt and an icon of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, asking permission, as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them, to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor of Peter and Paul, his patron saints. In another place the women with infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard work. On a third estate the priest, bearing a cross, came to meet him surrounded by children whom, by the countâ€™s generosity, he was instructing in reading, writing, and religion. On all his estates Pierre saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection, all on one plan, for hospitals, schools, and almshouses, which were soon to be opened. Everywhere he saw the stewardsâ€™ accounts, according to which the serfsâ€™ manorial labor had been diminished, and heard the touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their full-skirted blue coats.

What Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter and Paul was a market village where a fair was held on St. Peterâ€™s day, and that the richest peasants (who formed the deputation) had begun the chantry long before, but that nine tenths of the peasants in that villages were in a state of the greatest poverty. He did not know that since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land, they did still harder work on their own land. He did not know that the priest who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions, and that the pupilsâ€™ parents wept at having to let him take their children and secured their release by heavy payments. He did not know that the brick buildings, built to plan, were being built by serfs whose manorial labor was thus increased, though lessened on paper. He did not know that where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfsâ€™ payments had been diminished by a third, their obligatory manorial work had been increased by a half. And so Pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left Petersburg, and wrote enthusiastic letters to his â€œbrother-instructorâ€ as he called the Grand Master.

â€œHow easy it is, how little effort it needs, to do so much good,â€ thought Pierre, â€œand how little attention we pay to it!â€

He was pleased at the gratitude he received, but felt abashed at receiving it. This gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do for these simple, kindly people.

The chief steward, a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly through the naÃ¯ve and intelligent count and played with him as with a toy, seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre, pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all the uselessness of freeing the serfs, who were quite happy as it was.

Pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be difficult to imagine happier people, and that God only knew what would happen to them when they were free, but he insisted, though reluctantly, on what he thought right. The steward promised to do all in his power to carry out the countâ€™s wishes, seeing clearly that not only would the count never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the Land Bank, but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued to give in money and work all that other peopleâ€™s serfs gaveâ€”that is to say, all that could be got out of them.

CHAPTER XI
Returning from his journey through South Russia in the happiest state of mind, Pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his friend BolkÃ³nski, whom he had not seen for two years.

BoguchÃ¡rovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among fields and forests of fir and birch, which were partly cut down. The house lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and with banks still bare of grass. It was at the end of a village that stretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were a few fir trees.

The homestead consisted of a threshing floor, outhouses, stables, a bathhouse, a lodge, and a large brick house with semicircular faÃ§ade still in course of construction. Round the house was a garden newly laid out. The fences and gates were new and solid; two fire pumps and a water cart, painted green, stood in a shed; the paths were straight, the bridges were strong and had handrails. Everything bore an impress of tidiness and good management. Some domestic serfs Pierre met, in reply to inquiries as to where the prince lived, pointed out a small newly built lodge close to the pond. AntÃ³n, a man who had looked after Prince Andrew in his boyhood, helped Pierre out of his carriage, said that the prince was at home, and showed him into a clean little anteroom.

Pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in Petersburg.

He quickly entered the small reception room with its still-unplastered wooden walls redolent of pine, and would have gone farther, but AntÃ³n ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door.

â€œWell, what is it?â€ came a sharp, unpleasant voice.

â€œA visitor,â€ answered AntÃ³n.

â€œAsk him to wait,â€ and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back.

Pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to face with Prince Andrew, who came out frowning and looking old. Pierre embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek and looked at him closely.

â€œWell, I did not expect you, I am very glad,â€ said Prince Andrew.

Pierre said nothing; he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise. He was struck by the change in him. His words were kindly and there was a smile on his lips and face, but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous and glad sparkle. Prince Andrew had grown thinner, paler, and more manly-looking, but what amazed and estranged Pierre till he got used to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged concentration on some one thought.

As is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation, it was long before their conversation could settle on anything. They put questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to be talked over at length. At last the conversation gradually settled on some of the topics at first lightly touched on: their past life, plans for the future, Pierreâ€™s journeys and occupations, the war, and so on. The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his friendâ€™s look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to Pierre, especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past or the future. It was as if Prince Andrew would have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying, but could not. The latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms, dreams, and hopes of happiness or goodness, in Prince Andrewâ€™s presence. He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views, which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour. He checked himself, fearing to seem naÃ¯ve, yet he felt an irresistible desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite different, and better, Pierre than he had been in Petersburg.

â€œI canâ€™t tell you how much I have lived through since then. I hardly know myself again.â€

â€œYes, we have altered much, very much, since then,â€ said Prince Andrew.

â€œWell, and you? What are your plans?â€

â€œPlans!â€ repeated Prince Andrew ironically. â€œMy plans?â€ he said, as if astonished at the word. â€œWell, you see, Iâ€™m building. I mean to settle here altogether next year....â€

Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrewâ€™s face, which had grown much older.

â€œNo, I meant to ask...â€ Pierre began, but Prince Andrew interrupted him.

â€œBut why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about your travels and all you have been doing on your estates.â€

Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying as far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been made. Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierreâ€™s story of what he had been doing, as though it were all an old-time story, and he listened not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was telling him.

Pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friendâ€™s company and at last became silent.

â€œIâ€™ll tell you what, my dear fellow,â€ said Prince Andrew, who evidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor, â€œI am only bivouacking here and have just come to look round. I am going back to my sister today. I will introduce you to her. But of course you know her already,â€ he said, evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom he now found nothing in common. â€œWe will go after dinner. And would you now like to look round my place?â€

They went out and walked about till dinnertime, talking of the political news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other intimately. Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings, but even here, while on the scaffolding, in the midst of a talk explaining the future arrangements of the house, he interrupted himself:

â€œHowever, this is not at all interesting. Let us have dinner, and then weâ€™ll set off.â€

At dinner, conversation turned on Pierreâ€™s marriage.

â€œI was very much surprised when I heard of it,â€ said Prince Andrew.

Pierre blushed, as he always did when it was mentioned, and said hurriedly: â€œI will tell you some time how it all happened. But you know it is all over, and forever.â€

â€œForever?â€ said Prince Andrew. â€œNothingâ€™s forever.â€

â€œBut you know how it all ended, donâ€™t you? You heard of the duel?â€

â€œAnd so you had to go through that too!â€

â€œOne thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man,â€ said Pierre.

â€œWhy so?â€ asked Prince Andrew. â€œTo kill a vicious dog is a very good thing really.â€

â€œNo, to kill a man is badâ€”wrong.â€

â€œWhy is it wrong?â€ urged Prince Andrew. â€œIt is not given to man to know what is right and what is wrong. Men always did and always will err, and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong.â€

â€œWhat does harm to another is wrong,â€ said Pierre, feeling with pleasure that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was roused, had begun to talk, and wanted to express what had brought him to his present state.

â€œAnd who has told you what is bad for another man?â€ he asked.

â€œBad! Bad!â€ exclaimed Pierre. â€œWe all know what is bad for ourselves.â€

â€œYes, we know that, but the harm I am conscious of in myself is something I cannot inflict on others,â€ said Prince Andrew, growing more and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook to Pierre. He spoke in French. â€œI only know two very real evils in life: remorse and illness. The only good is the absence of those evils. To live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now.â€

â€œAnd love of oneâ€™s neighbor, and self-sacrifice?â€ began Pierre. â€œNo, I canâ€™t agree with you! To live only so as not to do evil and not to have to repent is not enough. I lived like that, I lived for myself and ruined my life. And only now when I am living, or at least tryingâ€ (Pierreâ€™s modesty made him correct himself) â€œto live for others, only now have I understood all the happiness of life. No, I shall not agree with you, and you do not really believe what you are saying.â€ Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile.

â€œWhen you see my sister, Princess Mary, youâ€™ll get on with her,â€ he said. â€œPerhaps you are right for yourself,â€ he added after a short pause, â€œbut everyone lives in his own way. You lived for yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness when you began living for others. I experienced just the reverse. I lived for glory.â€”And after all what is glory? The same love of others, a desire to do something for them, a desire for their approval.â€”So I lived for others, and not almost, but quite, ruined my life. And I have become calmer since I began to live only for myself.â€

â€œBut what do you mean by living only for yourself?â€ asked Pierre, growing excited. â€œWhat about your son, your sister, and your father?â€

â€œBut thatâ€™s just the same as myselfâ€”they are not others,â€ explained Prince Andrew. â€œThe others, oneâ€™s neighbors, le prochain, as you and Princess Mary call it, are the chief source of all error and evil. Le prochainâ€”your Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good.â€

And he looked at Pierre with a mocking, challenging expression. He evidently wished to draw him on.

â€œYou are joking,â€ replied Pierre, growing more and more excited. â€œWhat error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good, and even doing a littleâ€”though I did very little and did it very badly? What evil can there be in it if unfortunate people, our serfs, people like ourselves, were growing up and dying with no idea of God and truth beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in a comforting belief in future life, retribution, recompense, and consolation? What evil and error are there in it, if people were dying of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be rendered, and I supplied them with a doctor, a hospital, and an asylum for the aged? And is it not a palpable, unquestionable good if a peasant, or a woman with a baby, has no rest day or night and I give them rest and leisure?â€ said Pierre, hurrying and lisping. â€œAnd I have done that though badly and to a small extent; but I have done something toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good action, and more than that, you canâ€™t make me believe that you do not think so yourself. And the main thing is,â€ he continued, â€œthat I know, and know for certain, that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only sure happiness in life.â€

â€œYes, if you put it like that itâ€™s quite a different matter,â€ said Prince Andrew. â€œI build a house and lay out a garden, and you build hospitals. The one and the other may serve as a pastime. But whatâ€™s right and whatâ€™s good must be judged by one who knows all, but not by us. Well, you want an argument,â€ he added, â€œcome on then.â€

They rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served as a veranda.

â€œCome, letâ€™s argue then,â€ said Prince Andrew, â€œYou talk of schools,â€ he went on, crooking a finger, â€œeducation and so forth; that is, you want to raise himâ€ (pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off his cap) â€œfrom his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs, while it seems to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible, and that is just what you want to deprive him of. I envy him, but you want to make him what I am, without giving him my means. Then you say, â€˜lighten his toil.â€™ But as I see it, physical labor is as essential to him, as much a condition of his existence, as mental activity is to you or me. You canâ€™t help thinking. I go to bed after two in the morning, thoughts come and I canâ€™t sleep but toss about till dawn, because I think and canâ€™t help thinking, just as he canâ€™t help plowing and mowing; if he didnâ€™t, he would go to the drink shop or fall ill. Just as I could not stand his terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week, so he could not stand my physical idleness, but would grow fat and die. The third thingâ€”what else was it you talked about?â€ and Prince Andrew crooked a third finger. â€œAh, yes, hospitals, medicine. He has a fit, he is dying, and you come and bleed him and patch him up. He will drag about as a cripple, a burden to everybody, for another ten years. It would be far easier and simpler for him to die. Others are being born and there are plenty of them as it is. It would be different if you grudged losing a laborerâ€”thatâ€™s how I regard himâ€”but you want to cure him from love of him. And he does not want that. And besides, what a notion that medicine ever cured anyone! Killed them, yes!â€ said he, frowning angrily and turning away from Pierre.

Prince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was evident he had reflected on this subject more than once, and he spoke readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time. His glance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless.

â€œOh, that is dreadful, dreadful!â€ said Pierre. â€œI donâ€™t understand how one can live with such ideas. I had such moments myself not long ago, in Moscow and when traveling, but at such times I collapsed so that I donâ€™t live at allâ€”everything seems hateful to me... myself most of all. Then I donâ€™t eat, donâ€™t wash... and how is it with you?...â€

â€œWhy not wash? That is not cleanly,â€ said Prince Andrew; â€œon the contrary one must try to make oneâ€™s life as pleasant as possible. Iâ€™m alive, that is not my fault, so I must live out my life as best I can without hurting others.â€

â€œBut with such ideas what motive have you for living? One would sit without moving, undertaking nothing....â€

â€œLife as it is leaves one no peace. I should be thankful to do nothing, but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor to choose me to be their marshal; it was all I could do to get out of it. They could not understand that I have not the necessary qualifications for itâ€”the kind of good-natured, fussy shallowness necessary for the position. Then thereâ€™s this house, which must be built in order to have a nook of oneâ€™s own in which to be quiet. And now thereâ€™s this recruiting.â€

â€œWhy arenâ€™t you serving in the army?â€

â€œAfter Austerlitz!â€ said Prince Andrew gloomily. â€œNo, thank you very much! I have promised myself not to serve again in the active Russian army. And I wonâ€™tâ€”not even if Bonaparte were here at SmolÃ©nsk threatening Bald Hillsâ€”even then I wouldnâ€™t serve in the Russian army! Well, as I was saying,â€ he continued, recovering his composure, â€œnow thereâ€™s this recruiting. My father is chief in command of the Third District, and my only way of avoiding active service is to serve under him.â€

â€œThen you are serving?â€

â€œI am.â€

He paused a little while.

â€œAnd why do you serve?â€

â€œWhy, for this reason! My father is one of the most remarkable men of his time. But he is growing old, and though not exactly cruel he has too energetic a character. He is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is terrible, and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of the recruiting, granted by the Emperor. If I had been two hours late a fortnight ago he would have had a paymasterâ€™s clerk at YÃºkhnovna hanged,â€ said Prince Andrew with a smile. â€œSo I am serving because I alone have any influence with my father, and now and then can save him from actions which would torment him afterwards.â€

â€œWell, there you see!â€

â€œYes, but it is not as you imagine,â€ Prince Andrew continued. â€œI did not, and do not, in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who had stolen some boots from the recruits; I should even have been very glad to see him hanged, but I was sorry for my fatherâ€”that again is for myself.â€

Prince Andrew grew more and more animated. His eyes glittered feverishly while he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions there was no desire to do good to his neighbor.

â€œThere now, you wish to liberate your serfs,â€ he continued; â€œthat is a very good thing, but not for youâ€”I donâ€™t suppose you ever had anyone flogged or sent to Siberiaâ€”and still less for your serfs. If they are beaten, flogged, or sent to Siberia, I donâ€™t suppose they are any the worse off. In Siberia they lead the same animal life, and the stripes on their bodies heal, and they are happy as before. But it is a good thing for proprietors who perish morally, bring remorse upon themselves, stifle this remorse and grow callous, as a result of being able to inflict punishments justly and unjustly. It is those people I pity, and for their sake I should like to liberate the serfs. You may not have seen, but I have seen, how good men brought up in those traditions of unlimited power, in time when they grow more irritable, become cruel and harsh, are conscious of it, but cannot restrain themselves and grow more and more miserable.â€

Prince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help thinking that these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrew by his fatherâ€™s case.

He did not reply.

â€œSo thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m sorry forâ€”human dignity, peace of mind, purity, and not the serfsâ€™ backs and foreheads, which, beat and shave as you may, always remain the same backs and foreheads.â€

â€œNo, no! A thousand times no! I shall never agree with you,â€ said Pierre.

CHAPTER XII
In the evening Andrew and Pierre got into the open carriage and drove to Bald Hills. Prince Andrew, glancing at Pierre, broke the silence now and then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper.

Pointing to the fields, he spoke of the improvements he was making in his husbandry.

Pierre remained gloomily silent, answering in monosyllables and apparently immersed in his own thoughts.

He was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy, had gone astray, did not see the true light, and that he, Pierre, ought to aid, enlighten, and raise him. But as soon as he thought of what he should say, he felt that Prince Andrew with one word, one argument, would upset all his teaching, and he shrank from beginning, afraid of exposing to possible ridicule what to him was precious and sacred.

â€œNo, but why do you think so?â€ Pierre suddenly began, lowering his head and looking like a bull about to charge, â€œwhy do you think so? You should not think so.â€

â€œThink? What about?â€ asked Prince Andrew with surprise.

â€œAbout life, about manâ€™s destiny. It canâ€™t be so. I myself thought like that, and do you know what saved me? Freemasonry! No, donâ€™t smile. Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect, as I thought it was: Freemasonry is the best expression of the best, the eternal, aspects of humanity.â€

And he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince Andrew. He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed from the bonds of State and Church, a teaching of equality, brotherhood, and love.

â€œOnly our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life, all the rest is a dream,â€ said Pierre. â€œUnderstand, my dear fellow, that outside this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree with you that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out his life, like you, merely trying not to harm others. But make our fundamental convictions your own, join our brotherhood, give yourself up to us, let yourself be guided, and you will at once feel yourself, as I have felt myself, a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of which is hidden in heaven,â€ said Pierre.

Prince Andrew, looking straight in front of him, listened in silence to Pierreâ€™s words. More than once, when the noise of the wheels prevented his catching what Pierre said, he asked him to repeat it, and by the peculiar glow that came into Prince Andrewâ€™s eyes and by his silence, Pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that Prince Andrew would not interrupt him or laugh at what he said.

They reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to cross by ferry. While the carriage and horses were being placed on it, they also stepped on the raft.

Prince Andrew, leaning his arms on the raft railing, gazed silently at the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun.

â€œWell, what do you think about it?â€ Pierre asked. â€œWhy are you silent?â€

â€œWhat do I think about it? I am listening to you. Itâ€™s all very well.... You say: join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of life, the destiny of man, and the laws which govern the world. But who are we? Men. How is it you know everything? Why do I alone not see what you see? You see a reign of goodness and truth on earth, but I donâ€™t see it.â€

Pierre interrupted him.

â€œDo you believe in a future life?â€ he asked.

â€œA future life?â€ Prince Andrew repeated, but Pierre, giving him no time to reply, took the repetition for a denial, the more readily as he knew Prince Andrewâ€™s former atheistic convictions.

â€œYou say you canâ€™t see a reign of goodness and truth on earth. Nor could I, and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end of everything. On earth, here on this earthâ€ (Pierre pointed to the fields), â€œthere is no truth, all is false and evil; but in the universe, in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth, and we who are now the children of earth areâ€”eternallyâ€”children of the whole universe. Donâ€™t I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast harmonious whole? Donâ€™t I feel that I form one link, one step, between the lower and higher beings, in this vast harmonious multitude of beings in whom the Deityâ€”the Supreme Power if you prefer the termâ€”is manifest? If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man, why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther? I feel that I cannot vanish, since nothing vanishes in this world, but that I shall always exist and always have existed. I feel that beyond me and above me there are spirits, and that in this world there is truth.â€

â€œYes, that is Herderâ€™s theory,â€ said Prince Andrew, â€œbut it is not that which can convince me, dear friendâ€”life and death are what convince. What convinces is when one sees a being dear to one, bound up with oneâ€™s own life, before whom one was to blame and had hoped to make it rightâ€ (Prince Andrewâ€™s voice trembled and he turned away), â€œand suddenly that being is seized with pain, suffers, and ceases to exist.... Why? It cannot be that there is no answer. And I believe there is.... Thatâ€™s what convinces, that is what has convinced me,â€ said Prince Andrew.

â€œYes, yes, of course,â€ said Pierre, â€œisnâ€™t that what Iâ€™m saying?â€

â€œNo. All I say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the necessity of a future life, but this: when you go hand in hand with someone and all at once that person vanishes there, into nowhere, and you yourself are left facing that abyss, and look in. And I have looked in....â€

â€œWell, thatâ€™s it then! You know that there is a there and there is a Someone? There is the future life. The Someone isâ€”God.â€

Prince Andrew did not reply. The carriage and horses had long since been taken off, onto the farther bank, and reharnessed. The sun had sunk half below the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near the ferry, but Pierre and Andrew, to the astonishment of the footmen, coachmen, and ferrymen, still stood on the raft and talked.

â€œIf there is a God and future life, there is truth and good, and manâ€™s highest happiness consists in striving to attain them. We must live, we must love, and we must believe that we live not only today on this scrap of earth, but have lived and shall live forever, there, in the Whole,â€ said Pierre, and he pointed to the sky.

Prince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to Pierre, and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the sun gleaming on the blue waters. There was perfect stillness. Pierre became silent. The raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the current beat softly against it below. Prince Andrew felt as if the sound of the waves kept up a refrain to Pierreâ€™s words, whispering:

â€œIt is true, believe it.â€

He sighed, and glanced with a radiant, childlike, tender look at Pierreâ€™s face, flushed and rapturous, but yet shy before his superior friend.

â€œYes, if it only were so!â€ said Prince Andrew. â€œHowever, it is time to get on,â€ he added, and, stepping off the raft, he looked up at the sky to which Pierre had pointed, and for the first time since Austerlitz saw that high, everlasting sky he had seen while lying on that battlefield; and something that had long been slumbering, something that was best within him, suddenly awoke, joyful and youthful, in his soul. It vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions of his life, but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to develop existed within him. His meeting with Pierre formed an epoch in Prince Andrewâ€™s life. Though outwardly he continued to live in the same old way, inwardly he began a new life.

CHAPTER XIII
It was getting dusk when Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up to the front entrance of the house at Bald Hills. As they approached the house, Prince Andrew with a smile drew Pierreâ€™s attention to a commotion going on at the back porch. A woman, bent with age, with a wallet on her back, and a short, long-haired, young man in a black garment had rushed back to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up. Two women ran out after them, and all four, looking round at the carriage, ran in dismay up the steps of the back porch.

â€œThose are Maryâ€™s â€˜Godâ€™s folk,â€™â€ said Prince Andrew. â€œThey have mistaken us for my father. This is the one matter in which she disobeys him. He orders these pilgrims to be driven away, but she receives them.â€

â€œBut what are â€˜Godâ€™s folkâ€™?â€ asked Pierre.

Prince Andrew had no time to answer. The servants came out to meet them, and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back soon.

The old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute.

Prince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments, which were always kept in perfect order and readiness for him in his fatherâ€™s house; he himself went to the nursery.

â€œLet us go and see my sister,â€ he said to Pierre when he returned. â€œI have not found her yet, she is hiding now, sitting with her â€˜Godâ€™s folk.â€™ It will serve her right, she will be confused, but you will see her â€˜Godâ€™s folk.â€™ Itâ€™s really very curious.â€

â€œWhat are â€˜Godâ€™s folkâ€™?â€ asked Pierre.

â€œCome, and youâ€™ll see for yourself.â€

Princess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face when they went in. In her snug room, with lamps burning before the icon stand, a young lad with a long nose and long hair, wearing a monkâ€™s cassock, sat on the sofa beside her, behind a samovar. Near them, in an armchair, sat a thin, shriveled, old woman, with a meek expression on her childlike face.

â€œAndrew, why didnâ€™t you warn me?â€ said the princess, with mild reproach, as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her chickens.

â€œCharmÃ©e de vous voir. Je suis trÃ¨s contente de vous voir,â€ * she said to Pierre as he kissed her hand. She had known him as a child, and now his friendship with Andrew, his misfortune with his wife, and above all his kindly, simple face disposed her favorably toward him. She looked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say, â€œI like you very much, but please donâ€™t laugh at my people.â€ After exchanging the first greetings, they sat down.

* â€œDelighted to see you. I am very glad to see you.â€

â€œAh, and IvÃ¡nushka is here too!â€ said Prince Andrew, glancing with a smile at the young pilgrim.

â€œAndrew!â€ said Princess Mary, imploringly. â€œIl faut que vous sachiez que câ€™est une femme,â€ * said Prince Andrew to Pierre.

â€œAndrew, au nom de Dieu!â€ *(2) Princess Mary repeated.

* â€œYou must know that this is a woman.â€

* (2) â€œFor heavenâ€™s sake.â€

It was evident that Prince Andrewâ€™s ironical tone toward the pilgrims and Princess Maryâ€™s helpless attempts to protect them were their customary long-established relations on the matter.

â€œMais, ma bonne amie,â€ said Prince Andrew, â€œvous devriez au contraire mâ€™Ãªtre reconnaissante de ce que jâ€™explique Ã  Pierre votre intimitÃ© avec ce jeune homme.â€ *

* â€œBut, my dear, you ought on the contrary to be grateful to me for explaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young man.â€

â€œReally?â€ said Pierre, gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and seriousness (for which Princess Mary was specially grateful to him) into IvÃ¡nushkaâ€™s face, who, seeing that she was being spoken about, looked round at them all with crafty eyes.

Princess Maryâ€™s embarrassment on her peopleâ€™s account was quite unnecessary. They were not in the least abashed. The old woman, lowering her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers, had turned her cup upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it, and sat quietly in her armchair, though hoping to be offered another cup of tea. IvÃ¡nushka, sipping out of her saucer, looked with sly womanish eyes from under her brows at the young men.

â€œWhere have you been? To Kiev?â€ Prince Andrew asked the old woman.

â€œI have, good sir,â€ she answered garrulously. â€œJust at Christmastime I was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly sacrament at the shrine of the saint. And now Iâ€™m from KolyÃ¡zin, master, where a great and wonderful blessing has been revealed.â€

â€œAnd was IvÃ¡nushka with you?â€

â€œI go by myself, benefactor,â€ said IvÃ¡nushka, trying to speak in a bass voice. â€œI only came across PelagÃ©ya in YÃºkhnovo....â€

PelagÃ©ya interrupted her companion; she evidently wished to tell what she had seen.

â€œIn KolyÃ¡zin, master, a wonderful blessing has been revealed.â€

â€œWhat is it? Some new relics?â€ asked Prince Andrew.

â€œAndrew, do leave off,â€ said Princess Mary. â€œDonâ€™t tell him, PelagÃ©ya.â€

â€œNo... why not, my dear, why shouldnâ€™t I? I like him. He is kind, he is one of Godâ€™s chosen, heâ€™s a benefactor, he once gave me ten rubles, I remember. When I was in Kiev, Crazy Cyril says to me (heâ€™s one of Godâ€™s own and goes barefoot summer and winter), he says, â€˜Why are you not going to the right place? Go to KolyÃ¡zin where a wonder-working icon of the Holy Mother of God has been revealed.â€™ On hearing those words I said good-by to the holy folk and went.â€

All were silent, only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones, drawing in her breath.

â€œSo I come, master, and the people say to me: â€˜A great blessing has been revealed, holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed Mother, the Holy Virgin Mother of God.â€™...â€

â€œAll right, all right, you can tell us afterwards,â€ said Princess Mary, flushing.

â€œLet me ask her,â€ said Pierre. â€œDid you see it yourselves?â€ he inquired.

â€œOh, yes, master, I was found worthy. Such a brightness on the face like the light of heaven, and from the blessed Motherâ€™s cheek it drops and drops....â€

â€œBut, dear me, that must be a fraud!â€ said Pierre, naÃ¯vely, who had listened attentively to the pilgrim.

â€œOh, master, what are you saying?â€ exclaimed the horrified PelagÃ©ya, turning to Princess Mary for support.

â€œThey impose on the people,â€ he repeated.

â€œLord Jesus Christ!â€ exclaimed the pilgrim woman, crossing herself. â€œOh, donâ€™t speak so, master! There was a general who did not believe, and said, â€˜The monks cheat,â€™ and as soon as heâ€™d said it he went blind. And he dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev catacombs came to him and said, â€˜Believe in me and I will make you whole.â€™ So he begged: â€˜Take me to her, take me to her.â€™ Itâ€™s the real truth Iâ€™m telling you, I saw it myself. So he was brought, quite blind, straight to her, and he goes up to her and falls down and says, â€˜Make me whole,â€™ says he, â€˜and Iâ€™ll give thee what the Tsar bestowed on me.â€™ I saw it myself, master, the star is fixed into the icon. Well, and what do you think? He received his sight! Itâ€™s a sin to speak so. God will punish you,â€ she said admonishingly, turning to Pierre.

â€œHow did the star get into the icon?â€ Pierre asked.

â€œAnd was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general?â€ said Prince Andrew, with a smile.

PelagÃ©ya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands.

â€œOh, master, master, what a sin! And you who have a son!â€ she began, her pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red. â€œMaster, what have you said? God forgive you!â€ And she crossed herself. â€œLord forgive him! My dear, what does it mean?...â€ she asked, turning to Princess Mary. She got up and, almost crying, began to arrange her wallet. She evidently felt frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a house where such things could be said, and was at the same time sorry to have now to forgo the charity of this house.

â€œNow, why need you do it?â€ said Princess Mary. â€œWhy did you come to me?...â€

â€œCome, PelagÃ©ya, I was joking,â€ said Pierre. â€œPrincesse, ma parole, je nâ€™ai pas voulu lâ€™offenser. * I did not mean anything, I was only joking,â€ he said, smiling shyly and trying to efface his offense. â€œIt was all my fault, and Andrew was only joking.â€

* â€œPrincess, on my word, I did not wish to offend her.â€

PelagÃ©ya stopped doubtfully, but in Pierreâ€™s face there was such a look of sincere penitence, and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now at her and now at Pierre, that she was gradually reassured.

CHAPTER XIV
The pilgrim woman was appeased and, being encouraged to talk, gave a long account of Father Amphilochus, who led so holy a life that his hands smelled of incense, and how on her last visit to Kiev some monks she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs, and how she, taking some dried bread with her, had spent two days in the catacombs with the saints. â€œIâ€™d pray awhile to one, ponder awhile, then go on to another. Iâ€™d sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics, and there was such peace all around, such blessedness, that one donâ€™t want to come out, even into the light of heaven again.â€

Pierre listened to her attentively and seriously. Prince Andrew went out of the room, and then, leaving â€œGodâ€™s folkâ€ to finish their tea, Princess Mary took Pierre into the drawing room.

â€œYou are very kind,â€ she said to him.

â€œOh, I really did not mean to hurt her feelings. I understand them so well and have the greatest respect for them.â€

Princess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately.

â€œI have known you a long time, you see, and am as fond of you as of a brother,â€ she said. â€œHow do you find Andrew?â€ she added hurriedly, not giving him time to reply to her affectionate words. â€œI am very anxious about him. His health was better in the winter, but last spring his wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a cure. And I am also very much afraid for him spiritually. He has not a character like us women who, when we suffer, can weep away our sorrows. He keeps it all within him. Today he is cheerful and in good spirits, but that is the effect of your visitâ€”he is not often like that. If you could persuade him to go abroad. He needs activity, and this quiet regular life is very bad for him. Others donâ€™t notice it, but I see it.â€

Toward ten oâ€™clock the men servants rushed to the front door, hearing the bells of the old princeâ€™s carriage approaching. Prince Andrew and Pierre also went out into the porch.

â€œWhoâ€™s that?â€ asked the old prince, noticing Pierre as he got out of the carriage.

â€œAh! Very glad! Kiss me,â€ he said, having learned who the young stranger was.

The old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to Pierre.

Before supper, Prince Andrew, coming back to his fatherâ€™s study, found him disputing hotly with his visitor. Pierre was maintaining that a time would come when there would be no more wars. The old prince disputed it chaffingly, but without getting angry.

â€œDrain the blood from menâ€™s veins and put in water instead, then there will be no more war! Old womenâ€™s nonsenseâ€”old womenâ€™s nonsense!â€ he repeated, but still he patted Pierre affectionately on the shoulder, and then went up to the table where Prince Andrew, evidently not wishing to join in the conversation, was looking over the papers his father had brought from town. The old prince went up to him and began to talk business.

â€œThe marshal, a Count RostÃ³v, hasnâ€™t sent half his contingent. He came to town and wanted to invite me to dinnerâ€”I gave him a pretty dinner!... And there, look at this.... Well, my boy,â€ the old prince went on, addressing his son and patting Pierre on the shoulder. â€œA fine fellowâ€”your friendâ€”I like him! He stirs me up. Another says clever things and one doesnâ€™t care to listen, but this one talks rubbish yet stirs an old fellow up. Well, go! Get along! Perhaps Iâ€™ll come and sit with you at supper. Weâ€™ll have another dispute. Make friends with my little fool, Princess Mary,â€ he shouted after Pierre, through the door.

Only now, on his visit to Bald Hills, did Pierre fully realize the strength and charm of his friendship with Prince Andrew. That charm was not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his family and with the household. With the stern old prince and the gentle, timid Princess Mary, though he had scarcely known them, Pierre at once felt like an old friend. They were all fond of him already. Not only Princess Mary, who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims, gave him her most radiant looks, but even the one-year-old â€œPrince Nicholasâ€ (as his grandfather called him) smiled at Pierre and let himself be taken in his arms, and Michael IvÃ¡novich and Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at him with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince.

The old prince came in to supper; this was evidently on Pierreâ€™s account. And during the two days of the young manâ€™s visit he was extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again.

When Pierre had gone and the members of the household met together, they began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new acquaintance has left, but as seldom happens, no one said anything but what was good of him.

CHAPTER XV
When returning from his leave, RostÃ³v felt, for the first time, how close was the bond that united him to DenÃ­sov and the whole regiment.

On approaching it, RostÃ³v felt as he had done when approaching his home in Moscow. When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of his regiment, when he recognized red-haired DemÃ©ntyev and saw the picket ropes of the roan horses, when LavrÃºshka gleefully shouted to his master, â€œThe count has come!â€ and DenÃ­sov, who had been asleep on his bed, ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him, and the officers collected round to greet the new arrival, RostÃ³v experienced the same feeling as when his mother, his father, and his sister had embraced him, and tears of joy choked him so that he could not speak. The regiment was also a home, and as unalterably dear and precious as his parentsâ€™ house.

When he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had been reassigned to his former squadron, had been on duty and had gone out foraging, when he had again entered into all the little interests of the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one narrow, unchanging frame, he experienced the same sense of peace, of moral support, and the same sense of being at home here in his own place, as he had felt under the parental roof. But here was none of all that turmoil of the world at large, where he did not know his right place and took mistaken decisions; here was no SÃ³nya with whom he ought, or ought not, to have an explanation; here was no possibility of going there or not going there; here there were not twenty-four hours in the day which could be spent in such a variety of ways; there was not that innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or farther from him than another; there were none of those uncertain and undefined money relations with his father, and nothing to recall that terrible loss to DÃ³lokhov. Here, in the regiment, all was clear and simple. The whole world was divided into two unequal parts: one, our PÃ¡vlograd regiment; the other, all the rest. And the rest was no concern of his. In the regiment, everything was definite: who was lieutenant, who captain, who was a good fellow, who a bad one, and most of all, who was a comrade. The canteenkeeper gave one credit, oneâ€™s pay came every four months, there was nothing to think out or decide, you had only to do nothing that was considered bad in the PÃ¡vlograd regiment and, when given an order, to do what was clearly, distinctly, and definitely orderedâ€”and all would be well.

Having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental life, RostÃ³v felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to rest. Life in the regiment, during this campaign, was all the pleasanter for him, because, after his loss to DÃ³lokhov (for which, in spite of all his familyâ€™s efforts to console him, he could not forgive himself), he had made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving, not as he had done before, but really well, and by being a perfectly first-rate comrade and officerâ€”in a word, a splendid man altogether, a thing which seemed so difficult out in the world, but so possible in the regiment.

After his losses, he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents in five years. He received ten thousand rubles a year, but now resolved to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his parents.

Our army, after repeated retreats and advances and battles at PultÃºsk and Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It was awaiting the Emperorâ€™s arrival and the beginning of a new campaign.

The PÃ¡vlograd regiment, belonging to that part of the army which had served in the 1805 campaign, had been recruiting up to strength in Russia, and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the campaign. It had been neither at PultÃºsk nor at Preussisch-Eylau and, when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign, was attached to PlÃ¡tovâ€™s division.

PlÃ¡tovâ€™s division was acting independently of the main army. Several times parts of the PÃ¡vlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the enemy, had taken prisoners, and once had even captured Marshal Oudinotâ€™s carriages. In April the PÃ¡vlograds were stationed immovably for some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted German village.

A thaw had set in, it was muddy and cold, the ice on the river broke, and the roads became impassable. For days neither provisions for the men nor fodder for the horses had been issued. As no transports could arrive, the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages, searching for potatoes, but found few even of these.

Everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fledâ€”if any remained, they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken from them; even the soldiers, usually pitiless enough, instead of taking anything from them, often gave them the last of their rations.

The PÃ¡vlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action, but had lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness. In the hospitals, death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever, or the swelling that came from bad food, preferred to remain on duty, and hardly able to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals. When spring came on, the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the ground that looked like asparagus, which, for some reason, they called â€œMÃ¡shkaâ€™s sweet root.â€ It was very bitter, but they wandered about the fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it, though they were ordered not to do so, as it was a noxious plant. That spring a new disease broke out among the soldiers, a swelling of the arms, legs, and face, which the doctors attributed to eating this root. But in spite of all this, the soldiers of DenÃ­sovâ€™s squadron fed chiefly on â€œMÃ¡shkaâ€™s sweet root,â€ because it was the second week that the last of the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen.

The horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched roofs and had become terribly thin, though still covered with tufts of felty winter hair.

Despite this destitution, the soldiers and officers went on living just as usual. Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms, the hussars formed line for roll call, kept things in order, groomed their horses, polished their arms, brought in straw from the thatched roofs in place of fodder, and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which they rose up hungry, joking about their nasty food and their hunger. As usual, in their spare time, they lit bonfires, steamed themselves before them naked; smoked, picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes, told and listened to stories of PotÃ«mkinâ€™s and SuvÃ³rovâ€™s campaigns, or to legends of AlÃ«sha the Sly, or the priestâ€™s laborer MikÃ³lka.

The officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes in the roofless, half-ruined houses. The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and, in general, food for the men. The younger ones occupied themselves as before, some playing cards (there was plenty of money, though there was no food), some with more innocent games, such as quoits and skittles. The general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of, partly because nothing certain was known about it, partly because there was a vague feeling that in the main it was going badly.

RostÃ³v lived, as before, with DenÃ­sov, and since their furlough they had become more friendly than ever. DenÃ­sov never spoke of RostÃ³vâ€™s family, but by the tender friendship his commander showed him, RostÃ³v felt that the elder hussarâ€™s luckless love for NatÃ¡sha played a part in strengthening their friendship. DenÃ­sov evidently tried to expose RostÃ³v to danger as seldom as possible, and after an action greeted his safe return with evident joy. On one of his foraging expeditions, in a deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of provisions, RostÃ³v found a family consisting of an old Pole and his daughter with an infant in arms. They were half clad, hungry, too weak to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance. RostÃ³v brought them to his quarters, placed them in his own lodging, and kept them for some weeks while the old man was recovering. One of his comrades, talking of women, began chaffing RostÃ³v, saying that he was more wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if he introduced to them the pretty Polish girl he had saved. RostÃ³v took the joke as an insult, flared up, and said such unpleasant things to the officer that it was all DenÃ­sov could do to prevent a duel. When the officer had gone away, DenÃ­sov, who did not himself know what RostÃ³vâ€™s relations with the Polish girl might be, began to upbraid him for his quickness of temper, and RostÃ³v replied:

â€œSay what you like.... She is like a sister to me, and I canâ€™t tell you how it offended me... because... well, for that reason....â€

DenÃ­sov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room without looking at RostÃ³v, as was his way at moments of deep feeling.

â€œAh, what a mad bweed you WostÃ³vs are!â€ he muttered, and RostÃ³v noticed tears in his eyes.

CHAPTER XVI
In April the troops were enlivened by news of the Emperorâ€™s arrival, but RostÃ³v had no chance of being present at the review he held at Bartenstein, as the PÃ¡vlograds were at the outposts far beyond that place.

They were bivouacking. DenÃ­sov and RostÃ³v were living in an earth hut, dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf. The hut was made in the following manner, which had then come into vogue. A trench was dug three and a half feet wide, four feet eight inches deep, and eight feet long. At one end of the trench, steps were cut out and these formed the entrance and vestibule. The trench itself was the room, in which the lucky ones, such as the squadron commander, had a board, lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance, to serve as a table. On each side of the trench, the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet, and this did duty for bedsteads and couches. The roof was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table. DenÃ­sov, who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron liked him, had also a board in the roof at the farther end, with a piece of (broken but mended) glass in it for a window. When it was very cold, embers from the soldiersâ€™ campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the â€œreception roomâ€â€”as DenÃ­sov called that part of the hutâ€”and it was then so warm that the officers, of whom there were always some with DenÃ­sov and RostÃ³v, sat in their shirt sleeves.

In April, RostÃ³v was on orderly duty. One morning, between seven and eight, returning after a sleepless night, he sent for embers, changed his rain-soaked underclothes, said his prayers, drank tea, got warm, then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner, and, his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his shirt, lay down on his back, putting his arms under his head. He was pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days for his last reconnoitering expedition, and was awaiting DenÃ­sov, who had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk.

Suddenly he heard DenÃ­sov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut, evidently much excited. RostÃ³v moved to the window to see whom he was speaking to, and saw the quartermaster, TopchÃ©enko.

â€œI ordered you not to let them eat that MÃ¡shka woot stuff!â€ DenÃ­sov was shouting. â€œAnd I saw with my own eyes how LazarchÃºk bwought some fwom the fields.â€

â€œI have given the order again and again, your honor, but they donâ€™t obey,â€ answered the quartermaster.

RostÃ³v lay down again on his bed and thought complacently: â€œLet him fuss and bustle now, my jobâ€™s done and Iâ€™m lying downâ€”capitally!â€ He could hear that LavrÃºshkaâ€”that sly, bold orderly of DenÃ­sovâ€™sâ€”was talking, as well as the quartermaster. LavrÃºshka was saying something about loaded wagons, biscuits, and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for provisions.

Then DenÃ­sovâ€™s voice was heard shouting farther and farther away. â€œSaddle! Second platoon!â€

â€œWhere are they off to now?â€ thought RostÃ³v.

Five minutes later, DenÃ­sov came into the hut, climbed with muddy boots on the bed, lit his pipe, furiously scattered his things about, took his leaded whip, buckled on his saber, and went out again. In answer to RostÃ³vâ€™s inquiry where he was going, he answered vaguely and crossly that he had some business.

â€œLet God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards!â€ said DenÃ­sov going out, and RostÃ³v heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the mud. He did not even trouble to find out where DenÃ­sov had gone. Having got warm in his corner, he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till toward evening. DenÃ­sov had not yet returned. The weather had cleared up, and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing svÃ¡yka, laughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the soft mud. RostÃ³v joined them. In the middle of the game, the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses behind them. The wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them.

â€œThere now, DenÃ­sov has been worrying,â€ said RostÃ³v, â€œand here are the provisions.â€

â€œSo they are!â€ said the officers. â€œWonâ€™t the soldiers be glad!â€

A little behind the hussars came DenÃ­sov, accompanied by two infantry officers with whom he was talking.

RostÃ³v went to meet them.

â€œI warn you, Captain,â€ one of the officers, a short thin man, evidently very angry, was saying.

â€œHavenâ€™t I told you I wonâ€™t give them up?â€ replied DenÃ­sov.

â€œYou will answer for it, Captain. It is mutinyâ€”seizing the transport of oneâ€™s own army. Our men have had nothing to eat for two days.â€

â€œAnd mine have had nothing for two weeks,â€ said DenÃ­sov.

â€œIt is robbery! Youâ€™ll answer for it, sir!â€ said the infantry officer, raising his voice.

â€œNow, what are you pestewing me for?â€ cried DenÃ­sov, suddenly losing his temper. â€œI shall answer for it and not you, and youâ€™d better not buzz about here till you get hurt. Be off! Go!â€ he shouted at the officers.

â€œVery well, then!â€ shouted the little officer, undaunted and not riding away. â€œIf you are determined to rob, Iâ€™ll...â€

â€œGo to the devil! quick maâ€™ch, while youâ€™re safe and sound!â€ and DenÃ­sov turned his horse on the officer.

â€œVery well, very well!â€ muttered the officer, threateningly, and turning his horse he trotted away, jolting in his saddle.

â€œA dog astwide a fence! A weal dog astwide a fence!â€ shouted DenÃ­sov after him (the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a mounted infantryman) and riding up to RostÃ³v, he burst out laughing.

â€œIâ€™ve taken twansports from the infantwy by force!â€ he said. â€œAfter all, canâ€™t let our men starve.â€

The wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an infantry regiment, but learning from LavrÃºshka that the transport was unescorted, DenÃ­sov with his hussars had seized it by force. The soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely, and they even shared them with the other squadrons.

The next day the regimental commander sent for DenÃ­sov, and holding his fingers spread out before his eyes said:

â€œThis is how I look at this affair: I know nothing about it and wonâ€™t begin proceedings, but I advise you to ride over to the staff and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received. If not, as the demand was booked against an infantry regiment, there will be a row and the affair may end badly.â€

From the regimental commanderâ€™s, DenÃ­sov rode straight to the staff with a sincere desire to act on this advice. In the evening he came back to his dugout in a state such as RostÃ³v had never yet seen him in. DenÃ­sov could not speak and gasped for breath. When RostÃ³v asked what was the matter, he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse, feeble voice.

Alarmed at DenÃ­sovâ€™s condition, RostÃ³v suggested that he should undress, drink some water, and send for the doctor.

â€œTwy me for wobbewy... oh! Some more water... Let them twy me, but Iâ€™ll always thwash scoundwels... and Iâ€™ll tell the Empewoâ€™... Ice...â€ he muttered.

The regimental doctor, when he came, said it was absolutely necessary to bleed DenÃ­sov. A deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him.

â€œI get there,â€ began DenÃ­sov. â€œâ€˜Now then, whereâ€™s your chiefâ€™s quarters?â€™ They were pointed out. â€˜Please to wait.â€™ â€˜Iâ€™ve widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait. Announce me.â€™ Vewy well, so out comes their head chiefâ€”also took it into his head to lecture me: â€˜Itâ€™s wobbewy!â€™â€”â€˜Wobbewy,â€™ I say, â€˜is not done by man who seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers, but by him who takes them to fill his own pockets!â€™ â€˜Will you please be silent?â€™ â€˜Vewy good!â€™ Then he says: â€˜Go and give a weceipt to the commissioner, but your affair will be passed on to headquarters.â€™ I go to the commissioner. I enter, and at the table... who do you think? No, but wait a bit!... Who is it thatâ€™s starving us?â€ shouted DenÃ­sov, hitting the table with the fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down and the tumblers on it jumped about. â€œTelyÃ¡nin! â€˜What? So itâ€™s you whoâ€™s starving us to death! Is it? Take this and this!â€™ and I hit him so pat, stwaight on his snout... â€˜Ah, what a... what a...!â€™ and I staâ€™ted fwashing him... Well, Iâ€™ve had a bit of fun I can tell you!â€ cried DenÃ­sov, gleeful and yet angry, his white teeth showing under his black mustache. â€œIâ€™d have killed him if they hadnâ€™t taken him away!â€

â€œBut what are you shouting for? Calm yourself,â€ said RostÃ³v. â€œYouâ€™ve set your arm bleeding afresh. Wait, we must tie it up again.â€

DenÃ­sov was bandaged up again and put to bed. Next day he woke calm and cheerful.

But at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into RostÃ³vâ€™s and DenÃ­sovâ€™s dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed them a paper addressed to Major DenÃ­sov from the regimental commander in which inquiries were made about yesterdayâ€™s occurrence. The adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn: that a court-martial had been appointed, and that in view of the severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded, degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for.

The case, as represented by the offended parties, was that, after seizing the transports, Major DenÃ­sov, being drunk, went to the chief quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief, threatened to strike him, and on being led out had rushed into the office and given two officials a thrashing, and dislocated the arm of one of them.

In answer to RostÃ³vâ€™s renewed questions, DenÃ­sov said, laughing, that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it, but that it was all nonsense and rubbish, and he did not in the least fear any kind of trial, and that if those scoundrels dared attack him he would give them an answer that they would not easily forget.

DenÃ­sov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter, but RostÃ³v knew him too well not to detect that (while hiding it from others) at heart he feared a court-martial and was worried over the affair, which was evidently taking a bad turn. Every day, letters of inquiry and notices from the court arrived, and on the first of May, DenÃ­sov was ordered to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat office. On the previous day PlÃ¡tov reconnoitered with two Cossack regiments and two squadrons of hussars. DenÃ­sov, as was his wont, rode out in front of the outposts, parading his courage. A bullet fired by a French sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg. Perhaps at another time DenÃ­sov would not have left the regiment for so slight a wound, but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing at the staff and went into hospital.

CHAPTER XVII
In June the battle of Friedland was fought, in which the PÃ¡vlograds did not take part, and after that an armistice was proclaimed. RostÃ³v, who felt his friendâ€™s absence very much, having no news of him since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his affairs, took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit DenÃ­sov in hospital.

The hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twice devastated by Russian and French troops. Because it was summer, when it is so beautiful out in the fields, the little town presented a particularly dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences, its foul streets, tattered inhabitants, and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about.

The hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence that had been pulled to pieces. Several bandaged soldiers, with pale swollen faces, were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the yard.

Directly RostÃ³v entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of putrefaction and hospital air. On the stairs he met a Russian army doctor smoking a cigar. The doctor was followed by a Russian assistant.

â€œI canâ€™t tear myself to pieces,â€ the doctor was saying. â€œCome to MakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich in the evening. I shall be there.â€

The assistant asked some further questions.

â€œOh, do the best you can! Isnâ€™t it all the same?â€ The doctor noticed RostÃ³v coming upstairs.

â€œWhat do you want, sir?â€ said the doctor. â€œWhat do you want? The bullets having spared you, do you want to try typhus? This is a pesthouse, sir.â€

â€œHow so?â€ asked RostÃ³v.

â€œTyphus, sir. Itâ€™s death to go in. Only we two, MakÃ©ev and Iâ€ (he pointed to the assistant), â€œkeep on here. Some five of us doctors have died in this place.... When a new one comes he is done for in a week,â€ said the doctor with evident satisfaction. â€œPrussian doctors have been invited here, but our allies donâ€™t like it at all.â€

RostÃ³v explained that he wanted to see Major DenÃ­sov of the hussars, who was wounded.

â€œI donâ€™t know. I canâ€™t tell you, sir. Only think! I am alone in charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients! Itâ€™s well that the charitable Prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee and some lint each month or we should be lost!â€ he laughed. â€œFour hundred, sir, and theyâ€™re always sending me fresh ones. There are four hundred? Eh?â€ he asked, turning to the assistant.

The assistant looked fagged out. He was evidently vexed and impatient for the talkative doctor to go.

â€œMajor DenÃ­sov,â€ RostÃ³v said again. â€œHe was wounded at Molliten.â€

â€œDead, I fancy. Eh, MakÃ©ev?â€ queried the doctor, in a tone of indifference.

The assistant, however, did not confirm the doctorâ€™s words.

â€œIs he tall and with reddish hair?â€ asked the doctor.

RostÃ³v described DenÃ­sovâ€™s appearance.

â€œThere was one like that,â€ said the doctor, as if pleased. â€œThat one is dead, I fancy. However, Iâ€™ll look up our list. We had a list. Have you got it, MakÃ©ev?â€

â€œMakÃ¡r AlexÃ©evich has the list,â€ answered the assistant. â€œBut if youâ€™ll step into the officersâ€™ wards youâ€™ll see for yourself,â€ he added, turning to RostÃ³v.

â€œAh, youâ€™d better not go, sir,â€ said the doctor, â€œor you may have to stay here yourself.â€

But RostÃ³v bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant to show him the way.

â€œOnly donâ€™t blame me!â€ the doctor shouted up after him.

RostÃ³v and the assistant went into the dark corridor. The smell was so strong there that RostÃ³v held his nose and had to pause and collect his strength before he could go on. A door opened to the right, and an emaciated sallow man on crutches, barefoot and in underclothing, limped out and, leaning against the doorpost, looked with glittering envious eyes at those who were passing. Glancing in at the door, RostÃ³v saw that the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoats.

â€œMay I go in and look?â€

â€œWhat is there to see?â€ said the assistant.

But, just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in, RostÃ³v entered the soldiersâ€™ ward. The foul air, to which he had already begun to get used in the corridor, was still stronger here. It was a little different, more pungent, and one felt that this was where it originated.

In the long room, brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows, the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls, and leaving a passage in the middle. Most of them were unconscious and paid no attention to the newcomers. Those who were conscious raised themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces, and all looked intently at RostÃ³v with the same expression of hope, of relief, reproach, and envy of anotherâ€™s health. RostÃ³v went to the middle of the room and looking through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thing there. He stood still, looking silently around. He had not at all expected such a sight. Just before him, almost across the middle of the passage on the bare floor, lay a sick man, probably a Cossack to judge by the cut of his hair. The man lay on his back, his huge arms and legs outstretched. His face was purple, his eyes were rolled back so that only the whites were seen, and on his bare legs and arms which were still red, the veins stood out like cords. He was knocking the back of his head against the floor, hoarsely uttering some word which he kept repeating. RostÃ³v listened and made out the word. It was â€œdrink, drink, a drink!â€ RostÃ³v glanced round, looking for someone who would put this man back in his place and bring him water.

â€œWho looks after the sick here?â€ he asked the assistant.

Just then a commissariat soldier, a hospital orderly, came in from the next room, marching stiffly, and drew up in front of RostÃ³v.

â€œGood day, your honor!â€ he shouted, rolling his eyes at RostÃ³v and evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities.

â€œGet him to his place and give him some water,â€ said RostÃ³v, pointing to the Cossack.

â€œYes, your honor,â€ the soldier replied complacently, and rolling his eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter, but did not move.

â€œNo, itâ€™s impossible to do anything here,â€ thought RostÃ³v, lowering his eyes, and he was going out, but became aware of an intense look fixed on him on his right, and he turned. Close to the corner, on an overcoat, sat an old, unshaven, gray-bearded soldier as thin as a skeleton, with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on RostÃ³v. The manâ€™s neighbor on one side whispered something to him, pointing at RostÃ³v, who noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him. He drew nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him, the other had been amputated above the knee. His neighbor on the other side, who lay motionless some distance from him with his head thrown back, was a young soldier with a snub nose. His pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were rolled back. RostÃ³v looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran down his back.

â€œWhy, this one seems...â€ he began, turning to the assistant.

â€œAnd how weâ€™ve been begging, your honor,â€ said the old soldier, his jaw quivering. â€œHeâ€™s been dead since morning. After all weâ€™re men, not dogs.â€

â€œIâ€™ll send someone at once. He shall be taken awayâ€”taken away at once,â€ said the assistant hurriedly. â€œLet us go, your honor.â€

â€œYes, yes, let us go,â€ said RostÃ³v hastily, and lowering his eyes and shrinking, he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him, and went out of the room.

CHAPTER XVIII
Going along the corridor, the assistant led RostÃ³v to the officersâ€™ wards, consisting of three rooms, the doors of which stood open. There were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or sitting on them. Some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing gowns. The first person RostÃ³v met in the officersâ€™ ward was a thin little man with one arm, who was walking about the first room in a nightcap and hospital dressing gown, with a pipe between his teeth. RostÃ³v looked at him, trying to remember where he had seen him before.

â€œSee where weâ€™ve met again!â€ said the little man. â€œTÃºshin, TÃºshin, donâ€™t you remember, who gave you a lift at SchÃ¶n Grabern? And Iâ€™ve had a bit cut off, you see...â€ he went on with a smile, pointing to the empty sleeve of his dressing gown. â€œLooking for VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich DenÃ­sov? My neighbor,â€ he added, when he heard who RostÃ³v wanted. â€œHere, here,â€ and TÃºshin led him into the next room, from whence came sounds of several laughing voices.

â€œHow can they laugh, or even live at all here?â€ thought RostÃ³v, still aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in the soldiersâ€™ ward, and still seeming to see fixed on him those envious looks which had followed him out from both sides, and the face of that young soldier with eyes rolled back.

DenÃ­sov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket, though it was nearly noon.

â€œAh, WostÃ³v? How are you, how are you?â€ he called out, still in the same voice as in the regiment, but RostÃ³v noticed sadly that under this habitual ease and animation some new, sinister, hidden feeling showed itself in the expression of DenÃ­sovâ€™s face and the intonations of his voice.

His wound, though a slight one, had not yet healed even now, six weeks after he had been hit. His face had the same swollen pallor as the faces of the other hospital patients, but it was not this that struck RostÃ³v. What struck him was that DenÃ­sov did not seem glad to see him, and smiled at him unnaturally. He did not ask about the regiment, nor about the general state of affairs, and when RostÃ³v spoke of these matters did not listen.

RostÃ³v even noticed that DenÃ­sov did not like to be reminded of the regiment, or in general of that other free life which was going on outside the hospital. He seemed to try to forget that old life and was only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers. On RostÃ³vâ€™s inquiry as to how the matter stood, he at once produced from under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the rough draft of his answer to it. He became animated when he began reading his paper and specially drew RostÃ³vâ€™s attention to the stinging rejoinders he made to his enemies. His hospital companions, who had gathered round RostÃ³vâ€”a fresh arrival from the world outsideâ€”gradually began to disperse as soon as DenÃ­sov began reading his answer. RostÃ³v noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had already heard that story more than once and were tired of it. Only the man who had the next bed, a stout Uhlan, continued to sit on his bed, gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe, and little one-armed TÃºshin still listened, shaking his head disapprovingly. In the middle of the reading, the Uhlan interrupted DenÃ­sov.

â€œBut what I say is,â€ he said, turning to RostÃ³v, â€œit would be best simply to petition the Emperor for pardon. They say great rewards will now be distributed, and surely a pardon would be granted....â€

â€œMe petition the Empewoâ€™!â€ exclaimed DenÃ­sov, in a voice to which he tried hard to give the old energy and fire, but which sounded like an expression of irritable impotence. â€œWhat for? If I were a wobber I would ask mercy, but Iâ€™m being court-martialed for bwinging wobbers to book. Let them twy me, Iâ€™m not afwaid of anyone. Iâ€™ve served the Tsar and my countwy honowably and have not stolen! And am I to be degwaded?... Listen, Iâ€™m wâ€™iting to them stwaight. This is what I say: â€˜If I had wobbed the Tweasuwy...â€™â€

â€œItâ€™s certainly well written,â€ said TÃºshin, â€œbut thatâ€™s not the point, VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich,â€ and he also turned to RostÃ³v. â€œOne has to submit, and VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich doesnâ€™t want to. You know the auditor told you it was a bad business.â€

â€œWell, let it be bad,â€ said DenÃ­sov.

â€œThe auditor wrote out a petition for you,â€ continued TÃºshin, â€œand you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it. No doubt heâ€ (indicating RostÃ³v) â€œhas connections on the staff. You wonâ€™t find a better opportunity.â€

â€œHavenâ€™t I said Iâ€™m not going to gwovel?â€ DenÃ­sov interrupted him, went on reading his paper.

RostÃ³v had not the courage to persuade DenÃ­sov, though he instinctively felt that the way advised by TÃºshin and the other officers was the safest, and though he would have been glad to be of service to DenÃ­sov. He knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper.

When the reading of DenÃ­sovâ€™s virulent reply, which took more than an hour, was over, RostÃ³v said nothing, and he spent the rest of the day in a most dejected state of mind amid DenÃ­sovâ€™s hospital comrades, who had gathered round him, telling them what he knew and listening to their stories. DenÃ­sov was moodily silent all the evening.

Late in the evening, when RostÃ³v was about to leave, he asked DenÃ­sov whether he had no commission for him.

â€œYes, wait a bit,â€ said DenÃ­sov, glancing round at the officers, and taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window, where he had an inkpot, and sat down to write.

â€œIt seems itâ€™s no use knocking oneâ€™s head against a wall!â€ he said, coming from the window and giving RostÃ³v a large envelope. In it was the petition to the Emperor drawn up by the auditor, in which DenÃ­sov, without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials, simply asked for pardon.

â€œHand it in. It seems...â€

He did not finish, but gave a painfully unnatural smile.

CHAPTER XIX
Having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of DenÃ­sovâ€™s affairs, RostÃ³v rode to Tilsit with the letter to the Emperor.

On the thirteenth of June the French and Russian Emperors arrived in Tilsit. BorÃ­s DrubetskÃ³y had asked the important personage on whom he was in attendance, to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at Tilsit.

â€œI should like to see the great man,â€ he said, alluding to Napoleon, whom hitherto he, like everyone else, had always called Buonaparte.

â€œYou are speaking of Buonaparte?â€ asked the general, smiling.

BorÃ­s looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was being tested.

â€œI am speaking, Prince, of the Emperor Napoleon,â€ he replied. The general patted him on the shoulder, with a smile.

â€œYou will go far,â€ he said, and took him to Tilsit with him.

BorÃ­s was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the two Emperors met. He saw the raft, decorated with monograms, saw Napoleon pass before the French Guards on the farther bank of the river, saw the pensive face of the Emperor Alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern on the bank of the Niemen awaiting Napoleonâ€™s arrival, saw both Emperors get into boats, and saw how Napoleonâ€”reaching the raft firstâ€”stepped quickly forward to meet Alexander and held out his hand to him, and how they both retired into the pavilion. Since he had begun to move in the highest circles BorÃ­s had made it his habit to watch attentively all that went on around him and to note it down. At the time of the meeting at Tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with Napoleon and about the uniforms they wore, and listened attentively to words spoken by important personages. At the moment the Emperors went into the pavilion he looked at his watch, and did not forget to look at it again when Alexander came out. The interview had lasted an hour and fifty-three minutes. He noted this down that same evening, among other facts he felt to be of historic importance. As the Emperorâ€™s suite was a very small one, it was a matter of great importance, for a man who valued his success in the service, to be at Tilsit on the occasion of this interview between the two Emperors, and having succeeded in this, BorÃ­s felt that henceforth his position was fully assured. He had not only become known, but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him. Twice he had executed commissions to the Emperor himself, so that the latter knew his face, and all those at court, far from cold-shouldering him as at first when they considered him a newcomer, would now have been surprised had he been absent.

BorÃ­s lodged with another adjutant, the Polish Count ZhilÃ­nski. ZhilÃ­nski, a Pole brought up in Paris, was rich, and passionately fond of the French, and almost every day of the stay at Tilsit, French officers of the Guard and from French headquarters were dining and lunching with him and BorÃ­s.

On the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, Count ZhilÃ­nski arranged a supper for his French friends. The guest of honor was an aide-de-camp of Napoleonâ€™s, there were also several French officers of the Guard, and a page of Napoleonâ€™s, a young lad of an old aristocratic French family. That same day, RostÃ³v, profiting by the darkness to avoid being recognized in civilian dress, came to Tilsit and went to the lodging occupied by BorÃ­s and ZhilÃ­nski.

RostÃ³v, in common with the whole army from which he came, was far from having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon and the Frenchâ€”who from being foes had suddenly become friendsâ€”that had taken place at headquarters and in BorÃ­s. In the army, Bonaparte and the French were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger, contempt, and fear. Only recently, talking with one of PlÃ¡tovâ€™s Cossack officers, RostÃ³v had argued that if Napoleon were taken prisoner he would be treated not as a sovereign, but as a criminal. Quite lately, happening to meet a wounded French colonel on the road, RostÃ³v had maintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal Bonaparte. RostÃ³v was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of French officers in BorÃ­sâ€™ lodging, dressed in uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from the outposts of the flank. As soon as he noticed a French officer, who thrust his head out of the door, that warlike feeling of hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him. He stopped at the threshold and asked in Russian whether DrubetskÃ³y lived there. BorÃ­s, hearing a strange voice in the anteroom, came out to meet him. An expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face on first recognizing RostÃ³v.

â€œAh, itâ€™s you? Very glad, very glad to see you,â€ he said, however, coming toward him with a smile. But RostÃ³v had noticed his first impulse.

â€œIâ€™ve come at a bad time I think. I should not have come, but I have business,â€ he said coldly.

â€œNo, I only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment. Dans un moment je suis Ã  vous,â€ * he said, answering someone who called him.

* â€œIn a minute I shall be at your disposal.â€

â€œI see Iâ€™m intruding,â€ RostÃ³v repeated.

The look of annoyance had already disappeared from BorÃ­sâ€™ face: having evidently reflected and decided how to act, he very quietly took both RostÃ³vâ€™s hands and led him into the next room. His eyes, looking serenely and steadily at RostÃ³v, seemed to be veiled by something, as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality. So it seemed to RostÃ³v.

â€œOh, come now! As if you could come at a wrong time!â€ said BorÃ­s, and he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced him to his guests, explaining that he was not a civilian, but an hussar officer, and an old friend of his.

â€œCount ZhilÃ­nskiâ€”le Comte N. N.â€”le Capitaine S. S.,â€ said he, naming his guests. RostÃ³v looked frowningly at the Frenchmen, bowed reluctantly, and remained silent.

ZhilÃ­nski evidently did not receive this new Russian person very willingly into his circle and did not speak to RostÃ³v. BorÃ­s did not appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and, with the same pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which he had met RostÃ³v, tried to enliven the conversation. One of the Frenchmen, with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen, addressed the obstinately taciturn RostÃ³v, saying that the latter had probably come to Tilsit to see the Emperor.

â€œNo, I came on business,â€ replied RostÃ³v, briefly.

RostÃ³v had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of dissatisfaction on BorÃ­sâ€™ face, and as always happens to those in a bad humor, it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and that he was in everybodyâ€™s way. He really was in their way, for he alone took no part in the conversation which again became general. The looks the visitors cast on him seemed to say: â€œAnd what is he sitting here for?â€ He rose and went up to BorÃ­s.

â€œAnyhow, Iâ€™m in your way,â€ he said in a low tone. â€œCome and talk over my business and Iâ€™ll go away.â€

â€œOh, no, not at all,â€ said BorÃ­s. â€œBut if you are tired, come and lie down in my room and have a rest.â€

â€œYes, really...â€

They went into the little room where BorÃ­s slept. RostÃ³v, without sitting down, began at once, irritably (as if BorÃ­s were to blame in some way) telling him about DenÃ­sovâ€™s affair, asking him whether, through his general, he could and would intercede with the Emperor on DenÃ­sovâ€™s behalf and get DenÃ­sovâ€™s petition handed in. When he and BorÃ­s were alone, RostÃ³v felt for the first time that he could not look BorÃ­s in the face without a sense of awkwardness. BorÃ­s, with one leg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender fingers of his right, listened to RostÃ³v as a general listens to the report of a subordinate, now looking aside and now gazing straight into RostÃ³vâ€™s eyes with the same veiled look. Each time this happened RostÃ³v felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes.

â€œI have heard of such cases and know that His Majesty is very severe in such affairs. I think it would be best not to bring it before the Emperor, but to apply to the commander of the corps.... But in general, I think...â€

â€œSo you donâ€™t want to do anything? Well then, say so!â€ RostÃ³v almost shouted, not looking BorÃ­s in the face.

BorÃ­s smiled.

â€œOn the contrary, I will do what I can. Only I thought...â€

At that moment ZhilÃ­nskiâ€™s voice was heard calling BorÃ­s.

â€œWell then, go, go, go...â€ said RostÃ³v, and refusing supper and remaining alone in the little room, he walked up and down for a long time, hearing the lighthearted French conversation from the next room.

CHAPTER XX
RostÃ³v had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on DenÃ­sovâ€™s behalf. He could not himself go to the general in attendance as he was in mufti and had come to Tilsit without permission to do so, and BorÃ­s, even had he wished to, could not have done so on the following day. On that day, June 27, the preliminaries of peace were signed. The Emperors exchanged decorations: Alexander received the Cross of the Legion of Honor and Napoleon the Order of St. Andrew of the First Degree, and a dinner had been arranged for the evening, given by a battalion of the French Guards to the PreobrazhÃ©nsk battalion. The Emperors were to be present at that banquet.

RostÃ³v felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with BorÃ­s that, when the latter looked in after supper, he pretended to be asleep, and early next morning went away, avoiding BorÃ­s. In his civilian clothes and a round hat, he wandered about the town, staring at the French and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where the Russian and French Emperors were staying. In a square he saw tables being set up and preparations made for the dinner; he saw the Russian and French colors draped from side to side of the streets, with huge monograms A and N. In the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed.

â€œBorÃ­s doesnâ€™t want to help me and I donâ€™t want to ask him. Thatâ€™s settled,â€ thought Nicholas. â€œAll is over between us, but I wonâ€™t leave here without having done all I can for DenÃ­sov and certainly not without getting his letter to the Emperor. The Emperor!... He is here!â€ thought RostÃ³v, who had unconsciously returned to the house where Alexander lodged.

Saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were assembling, evidently preparing for the Emperor to come out.

â€œI may see him at any moment,â€ thought RostÃ³v. â€œIf only I were to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all... could they really arrest me for my civilian clothes? Surely not! He would understand on whose side justice lies. He understands everything, knows everything. Who can be more just, more magnanimous than he? And even if they did arrest me for being here, what would it matter?â€ thought he, looking at an officer who was entering the house the Emperor occupied. â€œAfter all, people do go in.... Itâ€™s all nonsense! Iâ€™ll go in and hand the letter to the Emperor myself so much the worse for DrubetskÃ³y who drives me to it!â€ And suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect, RostÃ³v felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house.

â€œNo, I wonâ€™t miss my opportunity now, as I did after Austerlitz,â€ he thought, expecting every moment to meet the monarch, and conscious of the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought. â€œI will fall at his feet and beseech him. He will lift me up, will listen, and will even thank me. â€˜I am happy when I can do good, but to remedy injustice is the greatest happiness,â€™â€ RostÃ³v fancied the sovereign saying. And passing people who looked after him with curiosity, he entered the porch of the Emperorâ€™s house.

A broad staircase led straight up from the entry, and to the right he saw a closed door. Below, under the staircase, was a door leading to the lower floor.

â€œWhom do you want?â€ someone inquired.

â€œTo hand in a letter, a petition, to His Majesty,â€ said Nicholas, with a tremor in his voice.

â€œA petition? This way, to the officer on dutyâ€ (he was shown the door leading downstairs), â€œonly it wonâ€™t be accepted.â€

On hearing this indifferent voice, RostÃ³v grew frightened at what he was doing; the thought of meeting the Emperor at any moment was so fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away, but the official who had questioned him opened the door, and RostÃ³v entered.

A short stout man of about thirty, in white breeches and high boots and a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on, standing in that room, and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a new pair of handsome silk-embroidered braces that, for some reason, attracted RostÃ³vâ€™s attention. This man was speaking to someone in the adjoining room.

â€œA good figure and in her first bloom,â€ he was saying, but on seeing RostÃ³v, he stopped short and frowned.

â€œWhat is it? A petition?â€

â€œWhat is it?â€ asked the person in the other room.

â€œAnother petitioner,â€ answered the man with the braces.

â€œTell him to come later. Heâ€™ll be coming out directly, we must go.â€

â€œLater... later! Tomorrow. Itâ€™s too late...â€

RostÃ³v turned and was about to go, but the man in the braces stopped him.

â€œWhom have you come from? Who are you?â€

â€œI come from Major DenÃ­sov,â€ answered RostÃ³v.

â€œAre you an officer?â€

â€œLieutenant Count RostÃ³v.â€

â€œWhat audacity! Hand it in through your commander. And go along with you... go,â€ and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed him.

RostÃ³v went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were many officers and generals in full parade uniform, whom he had to pass.

Cursing his temerity, his heart sinking at the thought of finding himself at any moment face to face with the Emperor and being put to shame and arrested in his presence, fully alive now to the impropriety of his conduct and repenting of it, RostÃ³v, with downcast eyes, was making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a familiar voice called him and a hand detained him.

â€œWhat are you doing here, sir, in civilian dress?â€ asked a deep voice.

It was a cavalry general who had obtained the Emperorâ€™s special favor during this campaign, and who had formerly commanded the division in which RostÃ³v was serving.

RostÃ³v, in dismay, began justifying himself, but seeing the kindly, jocular face of the general, he took him aside and in an excited voice told him the whole affair, asking him to intercede for DenÃ­sov, whom the general knew. Having heard RostÃ³v to the end, the general shook his head gravely.

â€œIâ€™m sorry, sorry for that fine fellow. Give me the letter.â€

Hardly had RostÃ³v handed him the letter and finished explaining DenÃ­sovâ€™s case, when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard on the stairs, and the general, leaving him, went to the porch. The gentlemen of the Emperorâ€™s suite ran down the stairs and went to their horses. Hayne, the same groom who had been at Austerlitz, led up the Emperorâ€™s horse, and the faint creak of a footstep RostÃ³v knew at once was heard on the stairs. Forgetting the danger of being recognized, RostÃ³v went close to the porch, together with some inquisitive civilians, and again, after two years, saw those features he adored: that same face and same look and step, and the same union of majesty and mildness.... And the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign rose again in RostÃ³vâ€™s soul in all its old force. In the uniform of the PreobrazhÃ©nsk regimentâ€”white chamois-leather breeches and high bootsâ€”and wearing a star RostÃ³v did not know (it was that of the LÃ©gion dâ€™honneur), the monarch came out into the porch, putting on his gloves and carrying his hat under his arm. He stopped and looked about him, brightening everything around by his glance. He spoke a few words to some of the generals, and, recognizing the former commander of RostÃ³vâ€™s division, smiled and beckoned to him.

All the suite drew back and RostÃ³v saw the general talking for some time to the Emperor.

The Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse. Again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers (among whom was RostÃ³v) moved nearer to the Emperor. Stopping beside his horse, with his hand on the saddle, the Emperor turned to the cavalry general and said in a loud voice, evidently wishing to be heard by all:

â€œI cannot do it, General. I cannot, because the law is stronger than I,â€ and he raised his foot to the stirrup.

The general bowed his head respectfully, and the monarch mounted and rode down the street at a gallop. Beside himself with enthusiasm, RostÃ³v ran after him with the crowd.

CHAPTER XXI
The Emperor rode to the square where, facing one another, a battalion of the PreobrazhÃ©nsk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the French Guards in their bearskin caps on the left.

As the Tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions, which presented arms, another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank, and at the head of them RostÃ³v recognized Napoleon. It could be no one else. He came at a gallop, wearing a small hat, a blue uniform open over a white vest, and the St. Andrew ribbon over his shoulder. He was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered saddlecloth. On approaching Alexander he raised his hat, and as he did so, RostÃ³v, with his cavalrymanâ€™s eye, could not help noticing that Napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle. The battalions shouted â€œHurrah!â€ and â€œVive lâ€™Empereur!â€ Napoleon said something to Alexander, and both Emperors dismounted and took each otherâ€™s hands. Napoleonâ€™s face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile. Alexander was saying something affable to him.

In spite of the trampling of the French gendarmesâ€™ horses, which were pushing back the crowd, RostÃ³v kept his eyes on every movement of Alexander and Bonaparte. It struck him as a surprise that Alexander treated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with the Tsar, as if such relations with an Emperor were an everyday matter to him.

Alexander and Napoleon, with the long train of their suites, approached the right flank of the PreobrazhÃ©nsk battalion and came straight up to the crowd standing there. The crowd unexpectedly found itself so close to the Emperors that RostÃ³v, standing in the front row, was afraid he might be recognized.

â€œSire, I ask your permission to present the Legion of Honor to the bravest of your soldiers,â€ said a sharp, precise voice, articulating every letter.

This was said by the undersized Napoleon, looking up straight into Alexanderâ€™s eyes. Alexander listened attentively to what was said to him and, bending his head, smiled pleasantly.

â€œTo him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war,â€ added Napoleon, accentuating each syllable, as with a composure and assurance exasperating to RostÃ³v, he ran his eyes over the Russian ranks drawn up before him, who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their Emperor.

â€œWill Your Majesty allow me to consult the colonel?â€ said Alexander and took a few hasty steps toward Prince KozlÃ³vski, the commander of the battalion.

Bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand, tore it in doing so, and threw it away. An aide-de-camp behind him rushed forward and picked it up.

â€œTo whom shall it be given?â€ the Emperor Alexander asked KozlÃ³vski, in Russian in a low voice.

â€œTo whomever Your Majesty commands.â€

The Emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and, glancing back, remarked:

â€œBut we must give him an answer.â€

KozlÃ³vski scanned the ranks resolutely and included RostÃ³v in his scrutiny.

â€œCan it be me?â€ thought RostÃ³v.

â€œLÃ¡zarev!â€ the colonel called, with a frown, and LÃ¡zarev, the first soldier in the rank, stepped briskly forward.

â€œWhere are you off to? Stop here!â€ voices whispered to LÃ¡zarev who did not know where to go. LÃ¡zarev stopped, casting a sidelong look at his colonel in alarm. His face twitched, as often happens to soldiers called before the ranks.

Napoleon slightly turned his head, and put his plump little hand out behind him as if to take something. The members of his suite, guessing at once what he wanted, moved about and whispered as they passed something from one to another, and a pageâ€”the same one RostÃ³v had seen the previous evening at BorÃ­sâ€™â€”ran forward and, bowing respectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment, laid in it an Order on a red ribbon. Napoleon, without looking, pressed two fingers together and the badge was between them. Then he approached LÃ¡zarev (who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch), looked round at the Emperor Alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally, and the small white hand holding the Order touched one of LÃ¡zarevâ€™s buttons. It was as if Napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch that soldierâ€™s breast for the soldier to be forever happy, rewarded, and distinguished from everyone else in the world. Napoleon merely laid the cross on LÃ¡zarevâ€™s breast and, dropping his hand, turned toward Alexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there. And it really did.

Officious hands, Russian and French, immediately seized the cross and fastened it to the uniform. LÃ¡zarev glanced morosely at the little man with white hands who was doing something to him and, still standing motionless presenting arms, looked again straight into Alexanderâ€™s eyes, as if asking whether he should stand there, or go away, or do something else. But receiving no orders, he remained for some time in that rigid position.

The Emperors remounted and rode away. The PreobrazhÃ©nsk battalion, breaking rank, mingled with the French Guards and sat down at the tables prepared for them.

LÃ¡zarev sat in the place of honor. Russian and French officers embraced him, congratulated him, and pressed his hands. Crowds of officers and civilians drew near merely to see him. A rumble of Russian and French voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square. Two officers with flushed faces, looking cheerful and happy, passed by RostÃ³v.

â€œWhat dâ€™you think of the treat? All on silver plate,â€ one of them was saying. â€œHave you seen LÃ¡zarev?â€

â€œI have.â€

â€œTomorrow, I hear, the PreobrazhÃ©nskis will give them a dinner.â€

â€œYes, but what luck for LÃ¡zarev! Twelve hundred francsâ€™ pension for life.â€

â€œHereâ€™s a cap, lads!â€ shouted a PreobrazhÃ©nsk soldier, donning a shaggy French cap.

â€œItâ€™s a fine thing! First-rate!â€

â€œHave you heard the password?â€ asked one Guardsâ€™ officer of another. â€œThe day before yesterday it was â€˜NapolÃ©on, France, bravoureâ€™; yesterday, â€˜Alexandre, Russie, grandeur.â€™ One day our Emperor gives it and next day Napoleon. Tomorrow our Emperor will send a St. Georgeâ€™s Cross to the bravest of the French Guards. It has to be done. He must respond in kind.â€

BorÃ­s, too, with his friend ZhilÃ­nski, came to see the PreobrazhÃ©nsk banquet. On his way back, he noticed RostÃ³v standing by the corner of a house.

â€œRostÃ³v! How dâ€™you do? We missed one another,â€ he said, and could not refrain from asking what was the matter, so strangely dismal and troubled was RostÃ³vâ€™s face.

â€œNothing, nothing,â€ replied RostÃ³v.

â€œYouâ€™ll call round?â€

â€œYes, I will.â€

RostÃ³v stood at that corner for a long time, watching the feast from a distance. In his mind, a painful process was going on which he could not bring to a conclusion. Terrible doubts rose in his soul. Now he remembered DenÃ­sov with his changed expression, his submission, and the whole hospital, with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease. So vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked round to see where the smell came from. Next he thought of that self-satisfied Bonaparte, with his small white hand, who was now an Emperor, liked and respected by Alexander. Then why those severed arms and legs and those dead men?... Then again he thought of LÃ¡zarev rewarded and DenÃ­sov punished and unpardoned. He caught himself harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened.

The smell of the food the PreobrazhÃ©nskis were eating and a sense of hunger recalled him from these reflections; he had to get something to eat before going away. He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning. There he found so many people, among them officers who, like himself, had come in civilian clothes, that he had difficulty in getting a dinner. Two officers of his own division joined him. The conversation naturally turned on the peace. The officers, his comrades, like most of the army, were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of Friedland. They said that had we held out a little longer Napoleon would have been done for, as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition. Nicholas ate and drank (chiefly the latter) in silence. He finished a couple of bottles of wine by himself. The process in his mind went on tormenting him without reaching a conclusion. He feared to give way to his thoughts, yet could not get rid of them. Suddenly, on one of the officersâ€™ saying that it was humiliating to look at the French, RostÃ³v began shouting with uncalled-for wrath, and therefore much to the surprise of the officers:

â€œHow can you judge whatâ€™s best?â€ he cried, the blood suddenly rushing to his face. â€œHow can you judge the Emperorâ€™s actions? What right have we to argue? We cannot comprehend either the Emperorâ€™s aims or his actions!â€

â€œBut I never said a word about the Emperor!â€ said the officer, justifying himself, and unable to understand RostÃ³vâ€™s outburst, except on the supposition that he was drunk.

But RostÃ³v did not listen to him.

â€œWe are not diplomatic officials, we are soldiers and nothing more,â€ he went on. â€œIf we are ordered to die, we must die. If weâ€™re punished, it means that we have deserved it, itâ€™s not for us to judge. If the Emperor pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude an alliance with him, it means that that is the right thing to do. If once we begin judging and arguing about everything, nothing sacred will be left! That way we shall be saying there is no Godâ€”nothing!â€ shouted Nicholas, banging the tableâ€”very little to the point as it seemed to his listeners, but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts.

â€œOur business is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! Thatâ€™s all....â€ said he.

â€œAnd to drink,â€ said one of the officers, not wishing to quarrel.

â€œYes, and to drink,â€ assented Nicholas. â€œHullo there! Another bottle!â€ he shouted.

In 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a fresh interview with the Emperor Napoleon, and in the upper circles of Petersburg there was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting.

CHAPTER XXII
In 1809 the intimacy between â€œthe worldâ€™s two arbiters,â€ as Napoleon and Alexander were called, was such that when Napoleon declared war on Austria a Russian corps crossed the frontier to co-operate with our old enemy Bonaparte against our old ally the Emperor of Austria, and in court circles the possibility of marriage between Napoleon and one of Alexanderâ€™s sisters was spoken of. But besides considerations of foreign policy, the attention of Russian society was at that time keenly directed on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all the departments of government.

Life meanwhileâ€”real life, with its essential interests of health and sickness, toil and rest, and its intellectual interests in thought, science, poetry, music, love, friendship, hatred, and passionsâ€”went on as usual, independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity with Napoleon Bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction.
