â€œWell, letâ€™s go and sing â€˜The Brook.â€™â€

â€œCome along!â€

â€œDo you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!â€ said NatÃ¡sha, stopping suddenly. â€œI feel so happy!â€

And she set off at a run along the passage.

SÃ³nya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran after NatÃ¡sha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and light, joyous steps. At the visitorsâ€™ request the young people sang the quartette, â€œThe Brook,â€ with which everyone was delighted. Then Nicholas sang a song he had just learned:

At nighttime in the moonâ€™s fair glow
    How sweet, as fancies wander free,
To feel that in this world thereâ€™s one
    Who still is thinking but of thee!

That while her fingers touch the harp
    Wafting sweet music oâ€™er the lea,
It is for thee thus swells her heart,
    Sighing its message out to thee...

A day or two, then blhss enppoilt,
    @ut oh! do him lijd a gbown-qp lady. She had a fan in her hald that k.e of the ,adies ha` civef hdr to h/ld. Assuming quipe the pose of a sobiedy wom!n (heaven knoss wh`n and whdre she had le`rned ht) sha talked with har partner$ fannhng herrelf and s-ilhng .ver the fan.

â€œDear, dear! Just look at her!â€ exad`imed the ckundesr as she crossed the "allr%om, poiftifg tn NatÃ¡3ha.

NatÃ¡sha bhush$d and laughed.
w himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the Ã©cossaise was ended, he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery, addressing the first violin:

â€œSemÃ«n! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?â€

This was the countâ€™s favorite dance, which he had danced in his youth. (Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise.)

â€œLook at Papa!â€ shouted NatÃ¡sha to the whole company, and quite forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.

And indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner, MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by a smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared the onlookers for what was to follow. As soon as the provocatively gay strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance) began to sound, all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfsâ€”the men on one side and the women on the otherâ€”who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry.

â€œJust look at the master! A regular eagle he is!â€ loudly remarked the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.

The count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did not want to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance. What was expressed by the whole of the countâ€™s plump figure, in MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna found expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose. But if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet, MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna produced no less impression by slight exertionsâ€”the least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp her footâ€”which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity. The dance grew livelier and livelier. The other couples could not attract a momentâ€™s attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so. All were watching the count and MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna. NatÃ¡sha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress, urging them to â€œlook at Papa!â€ though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple. In the intervals of the dance the count, breathing deeply, waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster. Faster, faster, and faster; lightly, more lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying round MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until, turning his partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas, raising his soft foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by NatÃ¡sha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.

â€œThatâ€™s how we used to dance in our time, ma chÃ¨re,â€ said the count.

â€œThat was a Daniel Cooper!â€ exclaimed MÃ¡rya DmÃ­trievna, tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily.

CHAPTER XXI
While in the RostÃ³vsâ€™ ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced, to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper, Count BezÃºkhov had a sixth stroke. The doctors pronounced recovery impossible. After a mute confession, communion was administered to the dying man, preparations made for the sacrament of unction, and in his house there was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments. Outside the house, beyond the gates, a group of undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up, waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral. The Military Governor of Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp to inquire after the countâ€™s health, came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of Catherineâ€™s court, Count BezÃºkhov.

The magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up respectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family. Prince VasÃ­li, who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days, escorted him to the door, repeating something to him several times in low tones.

When the Military Governor had gone, Prince VasÃ­li sat down all alone on a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the other, leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand. After sitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him with frightened eyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the back of the house, to the room of the eldest princess.

Those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous whispers, and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying manâ€™s room, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at his door, which creaked slightly when opened.

â€œThe limits of human life ... are fixed and may not be oâ€™erpassed,â€ said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was listening naÃ¯vely to his words.

â€œI wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?â€ asked the lady, adding the priestâ€™s clerical title, as if she had no opinion of her own on the subject.

â€œAh, madam, it is a great sacrament,â€ replied the priest, passing his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald head.

â€œWho was that? The Military Governor himself?â€ was being asked at the other side of the room. â€œHow young-looking he is!â€

â€œYes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count no longer recognizes anyone. They wished to administer the sacrament of unction.â€

â€œI knew someone who received that sacrament seven times.â€

The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a table.

â€œBeautiful,â€ said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather. â€œThe weather is beautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow one feels as if one were in the country.â€

â€œYes, indeed,â€ replied the princess with a sigh. â€œSo he may have something to drink?â€

Lorrain considered.

â€œHas he taken his medicine?â€

â€œYes.â€

The doctor glanced at his watch.

â€œTake a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar,â€ and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.

â€œDere has neffer been a gase,â€ a German doctor was saying to an aide-de-camp, â€œdat one liffs after de sird stroke.â€

â€œAnd what a well-preserved man he was!â€ remarked the aide-de-camp. â€œAnd who will inherit his wealth?â€ he added in a whisper.

â€œIt vonâ€™t go begging,â€ replied the German with a smile.

Everyone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to Lorrainâ€™s instructions. The German doctor went up to Lorrain.

â€œDo you think he can last till morning?â€ asked the German, addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.

Lorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger before his nose.

â€œTonight, not later,â€ said he in a low voice, and he moved away with a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to understand and state the patientâ€™s condition.

Meanwhile Prince VasÃ­li had opened the door into the princessâ€™ room.

In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles. The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture, whatnots, cupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a high, white feather bed was just visible behind a screen. A small dog began to bark.

â€œAh, is it you, cousin?â€

She rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with varnish.

â€œHas anything happened?â€ she asked. â€œI am so terrified.â€

â€œNo, there is no change. I only came to have a talk about business, Catiche,â€ * muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on the chair she had just vacated. â€œYou have made the place warm, I must say,â€ he remarked. â€œWell, sit down: letâ€™s have a talk.â€

* Catherine.

â€œI thought perhaps something had happened,â€ she said with her unchanging stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the prince, she prepared to listen.

â€œI wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I canâ€™t.â€

â€œWell, my dear?â€ said Prince VasÃ­li, taking her hand and bending it downwards as was his habit.

It was plain that this â€œwell?â€ referred to much that they both understood without naming.

The princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her legs, looked directly at Prince VasÃ­li with no sign of emotion in her prominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons with a sigh. This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long. Prince VasÃ­li understood it as an expression of weariness.

â€œAnd I?â€ he said; â€œdo you think it is easier for me? I am as worn out as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a very serious talk.â€

Prince VasÃ­li said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously, now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His eyes too seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next glanced round in alarm.

The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands, looked attentively into Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s eyes evidently resolved not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till morning.

â€œWell, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine SemÃ«novna,â€ continued Prince VasÃ­li, returning to his theme, apparently not without an inner struggle; â€œat such a moment as this one must think of everything. One must think of the future, of all of you... I love you all, like children of my own, as you know.â€

The princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the same dull expression.

â€œAnd then of course my family has also to be considered,â€ Prince VasÃ­li went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at her. â€œYou know, Catiche, that weâ€”you three sisters, MÃ¡montov, and my wifeâ€”are the countâ€™s only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard it is for you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for me; but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything. Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count,â€ pointing to his portrait, â€œdefinitely demanded that he should be called.â€

Prince VasÃ­li looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was simply looking at him.

â€œThere is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin,â€ she replied, â€œand it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow his noble soul peacefully to leave this...â€

â€œYes, yes, of course,â€ interrupted Prince VasÃ­li impatiently, rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that he had pushed away. â€œBut... in short, the fact is... you know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre.â€

â€œHe has made wills enough!â€ quietly remarked the princess. â€œBut he cannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate.â€

â€œBut, my dear,â€ said Prince VasÃ­li suddenly, clutching the little table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: â€œwhat if a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for Pierreâ€™s legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of the countâ€™s services, his request would be granted?...â€

The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the subject under discussion than those they are talking with.

â€œI can tell you more,â€ continued Prince VasÃ­li, seizing her hand, â€œthat letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew of it. The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not, then as soon as all is over,â€ and Prince VasÃ­li sighed to intimate what he meant by the words all is over, â€œand the countâ€™s papers are opened, the will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and the petition will certainly be granted. Pierre will get everything as the legitimate son.â€

â€œAnd our share?â€ asked the princess smiling ironically, as if anything might happen, only not that.

â€œBut, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be the legal heir to everything and you wonâ€™t get anything. You must know, my dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether they have been destroyed or not. And if they have somehow been overlooked, you ought to know where they are, and must find them, because...â€

â€œWhat next?â€ the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not changing the expression of her eyes. â€œI am a woman, and you think we are all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit... un bÃ¢tard!â€* she added, as if supposing that this translation of the word would effectively prove to Prince VasÃ­li the invalidity of his contention.

* A bastard.

â€œWell, really, Catiche! Canâ€™t you understand! You are so intelligent, how is it you donâ€™t see that if the count has written a letter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it follows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count BezÃºkhov, and will then inherit everything under the will? And if the will and letter are not destroyed, then you will have nothing but the consolation of having been dutiful et tout ce qui sâ€™ensuit!* Thatâ€™s certain.â€

* And all that follows therefrom.

â€œI know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid; and you, mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool,â€ said the princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something witty and stinging.

â€œMy dear Princess Catherine SemÃ«novna,â€ began Prince VasÃ­li impatiently, â€œI came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about your interests as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation. And I tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the will in Pierreâ€™s favor are among the countâ€™s papers, then, my dear girl, you and your sisters are not heiresses! If you donâ€™t believe me, then believe an expert. I have just been talking to DmÃ­tri OnÃºfrichâ€ (the family solicitor) â€œand he says the same.â€

At this a sudden change evidently took place in the princessâ€™ ideas; her thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself evidently did not expect.

â€œThat would be a fine thing!â€ said she. â€œI never wanted anything and I donâ€™t now.â€

She pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.

â€œAnd this is gratitudeâ€”this is recognition for those who have sacrificed everything for his sake!â€ she cried. â€œItâ€™s splendid! Fine! I donâ€™t want anything, Prince.â€

â€œYes, but you are not the only one. There are your sisters...â€ replied Prince VasÃ­li.

But the princess did not listen to him.

â€œYes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I could expect nothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and ingratitudeâ€”the blackest ingratitudeâ€”in this house...â€

â€œDo you or do you not know where that will is?â€ insisted Prince VasÃ­li, his cheeks twitching more than ever.

â€œYes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, loved them, and sacrificed myself. But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who has been intriguing!â€

The princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand. She had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race. She gave her companion an angry glance.

â€œThere is still time, my dear. You must remember, Catiche, that it was all done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who...â€

â€œWho sacrificed everything for him,â€ chimed in the princess, who would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, â€œthough he never could appreciate it. No, mon cousin,â€ she added with a sigh, â€œI shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward, that in this world there is neither honor nor justice. In this world one has to be cunning and cruel.â€

â€œNow come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart.â€

â€œNo, I have a wicked heart.â€

â€œI know your heart,â€ repeated the prince. â€œI value your friendship and wish you to have as good an opinion of me. Donâ€™t upset yourself, and let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or be it but an hour.... Tell me all you know about the will, and above all where it is. You must know. We will take it at once and show it to the count. He has, no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it. You understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes; that is my only reason for being here. I came simply to help him and you.â€

â€œNow I see it all! I know who has been intriguingâ€”I know!â€ cried the princess.

â€œThatâ€™s not the point, my dear.â€

â€œItâ€™s that protÃ©gÃ© of yours, that sweet Princess DrubetskÃ¡ya, that Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... the infamous, vile woman!â€

â€œDo not let us lose any time...â€

â€œAh, donâ€™t talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here and told the count such vile, disgraceful things about us, especially about Sophieâ€”I canâ€™t repeat themâ€”that it made the count quite ill and he would not see us for a whole fortnight. I know it was then he wrote this vile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was invalid.â€

â€œWeâ€™ve got to it at lastâ€”why did you not tell me about it sooner?â€

â€œItâ€™s in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow,â€ said the princess, ignoring his question. â€œNow I know! Yes; if I have a sin, a great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!â€ almost shrieked the princess, now quite changed. â€œAnd what does she come worming herself in here for? But I will give her a piece of my mind. The time will come!â€

CHAPTER XXII
While these conversations were going on in the reception room and the princessâ€™ room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had been sent for) and Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna (who found it necessary to accompany him) was driving into the court of Count BezÃºkhovâ€™s house. As the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows, Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, having turned with words of comfort to her companion, realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke him up. Rousing himself, Pierre followed Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna out of the carriage, and only then began to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him. He noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back door. While he was getting down from the carriage steps two men, who looked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides. But neither Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who could not help seeing these people, took any notice of them. â€œIt seems to be all right,â€ Pierre concluded, and followed Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. She hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to Pierre, who was lagging behind, to follow. Though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less why he had to go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâ€™s air of assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary. Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who, carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots clattering. These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there.

â€œIs this the way to the princessesâ€™ apartments?â€ asked Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna of one of them.

â€œYes,â€ replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were now permissible; â€œthe door to the left, maâ€™am.â€

â€œPerhaps the count did not ask for me,â€ said Pierre when he reached the landing. â€œIâ€™d better go to my own room.â€

Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna paused and waited for him to come up.

â€œAh, my friend!â€ she said, touching his arm as she had done her sonâ€™s when speaking to him that afternoon, â€œbelieve me I suffer no less than you do, but be a man!â€

â€œBut really, hadnâ€™t I better go away?â€ he asked, looking kindly at her over his spectacles.

â€œAh, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have been done you. Think that he is your father ... perhaps in the agony of death.â€ She sighed. â€œI have loved you like a son from the first. Trust yourself to me, Pierre. I shall not forget your interests.â€

Pierre did not understand a word, but the conviction that all this had to be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna who was already opening a door.

This door led into a back anteroom. An old man, a servant of the princesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking. Pierre had never been in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of these rooms. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as â€œmy dearâ€ and â€œmy sweet,â€ asked about the princessâ€™ health and then led Pierre along a stone passage. The first door on the left led into the princessesâ€™ apartments. The maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything in the house was done in haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room, where Prince VasÃ­li and the eldest princess were sitting close together talking. Seeing them pass, Prince VasÃ­li drew back with obvious impatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all her might.

This action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly and sighed, as if to say that this was no more than she had expected.

â€œBe a man, my friend. I will look after your interests,â€ said she in reply to his look, and went still faster along the passage.

Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what â€œwatching over his interestsâ€ meant, but he decided that all these things had to be. From the passage they went into a large, dimly lit room adjoining the countâ€™s reception room. It was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front approach, but even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and water had been spilled on the carpet. They were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them. They went into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian windows opening into the conservatory, with its large bust and full length portrait of Catherine the Great. The same people were still sitting here in almost the same positions as before, whispering to one another. All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna as she entered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre who, hanging his head, meekly followed her.

Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâ€™s face expressed a consciousness that the decisive moment had arrived. With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now, keeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room even more boldly than that afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her the person the dying man wished to see, her own admission was assured. Casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the countâ€™s confessor there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing first of one and then of another priest.

â€œGod be thanked that you are in time,â€ said she to one of the priests; â€œall we relatives have been in such anxiety. This young man is the countâ€™s son,â€ she added more softly. â€œWhat a terrible moment!â€

Having said this she went up to the doctor.

â€œDear doctor,â€ said she, â€œthis young man is the countâ€™s son. Is there any hope?â€

The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his shoulders. Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna with just the same movement raised her shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved away from the doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful and tenderly sad voice, she said:

â€œTrust in His mercy!â€ and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and wait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone was watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it.

Pierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, moved toward the sofa she had indicated. As soon as Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed that they whispered to one another, casting significant looks at him with a kind of awe and even servility. A deference such as he had never before received was shown him. A strange lady, the one who had been talking to the priests, rose and offered him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up and returned a glove Pierre had dropped; the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by, and moved to make way for him. At first Pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way; but all at once he felt that this would not do, and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound to accept their services. He took the glove in silence from the aide-de-camp, and sat down in the ladyâ€™s chair, placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the naÃ¯ve attitude of an Egyptian statue, and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him.

Not two minutes had passed before Prince VasÃ­li with head erect majestically entered the room. He was wearing his long coat with three stars on his breast. He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning; his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed Pierre. He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never used to do), and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on.

â€œCourage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you. That is well!â€ and he turned to go.

But Pierre thought it necessary to ask: â€œHow is...â€ and hesitated, not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man â€œthe count,â€ yet ashamed to call him â€œfather.â€

â€œHe had another stroke about half an hour ago. Courage, my friend...â€

Pierreâ€™s mind was in such a confused state that the word â€œstrokeâ€ suggested to him a blow from something. He looked at Prince VasÃ­li in perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness. Prince VasÃ­li said something to Lorrain in passing and went through the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked at each step. The eldest princess followed him, and the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door. Through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about, and at last Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, still with the same expression, pale but resolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly on the arm said:

â€œThe divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be administered. Come.â€

Pierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed that the strange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all followed him in, as if there were now no further need for permission to enter that room.
