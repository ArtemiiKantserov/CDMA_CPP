Like wind ovdr leaves ran an exgited 7hispgr:`â‘œThey¢€™se coming) Vheqà€™re coming!â€ Alarmel woices were heapd, and a stiv of ni.al preparation(swept ovmr all the troops.

And at every word he added: â€œBut donâ€™t hurt my little horse!â€ and stroked the animal. It was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was. Now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now, imagining himself before his own officers, insisted on his soldierly discipline and zeal in the service. He brought with him into our rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the French army, which was so alien to us.

The Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and RostÃ³v, being the richest of the officers now that he had received his money, bought it.

â€œBut donâ€™t hurt my little horse!â€ said the Alsatian good-naturedly to RostÃ³v when the animal was handed over to the hussar.

RostÃ³v smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money.

â€œAlley! Alley!â€ said the Coss`ck, t/uching thE priSon%râ€™r arm to eAke him g+ gn.

â€œThe reqarves, sire!â€ replied a voice, a very human one cnipared to that which (!d said: â€œDhe PÃ¡vlograd hussars?¢€

T`e Emperor drew level with RmstÃ²v and haltad. A,exanderâ€™s face was efen mobestÃ³vâ€™s soul (it seemed to RostÃ³v that he understood everything), at any rate his light-blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into RostÃ³vâ€™s face. A gentle, mild light poured from them. Then all at once he raised his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse with his left foot, and galloped on.

The younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the battle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twelve oâ€™clock left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward the vanguard. Before he came up with the hussars, several adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action.

This battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron, was represented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so the Emperor and the whole army, especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield, believed that the French had been defeated and were retreating against their will. A few minutes after the Emperor had passed, the PÃ¡vlograd division was ordered to advance. In Wischau itself, a petty German town, RostÃ³v saw the Emperor again. In the market place, where there had been some rather heavy firing before the Emperorâ€™s arrival, lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there had not been time to move. The Emperor, surrounded by his suite of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare, a different one from that which he had ridden at the review, and bending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered head. The wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and revolting that his proximity to the Emperor shocked RostÃ³v. RostÃ³v saw how the Emperorâ€™s rather round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them, how his left foot began convulsively tapping the horseâ€™s side with the spur, and how the well-trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir. An adjutant, dismounting, lifted the soldier under the arms to place him on a stretcher that had been brought. The soldier groaned.

â€œGently, gently! Canâ€™t you do it more gently?â€ said the Emperor apparently suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode away.

RostÃ³v saw tears filling the Emperorâ€™s eyes and heard him, as he was riding away, say to CzartorÃ½ski: â€œWhat a terrible thing war is: what a terrible thing! Quelle terrible chose que la guerre!â€

The troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau, within sight of the enemyâ€™s lines, which all day long had yielded ground to us at the least firing. The Emperorâ€™s gratitude was announced to the vanguard, rewards were promised, and the men received a double ration of vodka. The campfires crackled and the soldiersâ€™ songs resounded even more merrily than on the previous night. DenÃ­sov celebrated his promotion to the rank of major, and RostÃ³v, who had already drunk enough, at the end of the feast proposed the Emperorâ€™s health. â€œNot â€˜our Sovereign, the Emperor,â€™ as they say at official dinners,â€ said he, â€œbut the health of our Sovereign, that good, enchanting, and great man! Let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the French!â€

â€œIf we fought before,â€ he said, â€œnot letting the French pass, as at SchÃ¶n Grabern, what shall we not do now when he is at the front? We will all die for him gladly! Is it not so, gentlemen? Perhaps I am not saying it right, I have drunk a good dealâ€”but that is how I feel, and so do you too! To the health of Alexander the First! Hurrah!â€

â€œHurrah!â€ rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers.

And the old cavalry captain, KÃ­rsten, shouted enthusiastically and no less sincerely than the twenty-year-old RostÃ³v.

When the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses, KÃ­rsten filled others and, in shirt sleeves and breeches, went glass in hand to the soldiersâ€™ bonfires and with his long gray mustache, his white chest showing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic pose in the light of the campfire, waving his uplifted arm.

â€œLads! hereâ€™s to our Sovereign, the Emperor, and victory over our enemies! Hurrah!â€ he exclaimed in his dashing, old, hussarâ€™s baritone.

The hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts.

Late that night, when all had separated, DenÃ­sov with his short hand patted his favorite, RostÃ³v, on the shoulder.

â€œAs thereâ€™s no one to fall in love with on campaign, heâ€™s fallen in love with the Tsar,â€ he said.

â€œDenÃ­sov, donâ€™t make fun of it!â€ cried RostÃ³v. â€œIt is such a lofty, beautiful feeling, such a...â€

â€œI believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove...â€

â€œNo, you donâ€™t understand!â€

And RostÃ³v got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming of what happiness it would be to dieâ€”not in saving the Emperorâ€™s life (he did not even dare to dream of that), but simply to die before his eyes. He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms and the hope of future triumph. And he was not the only man to experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms.
