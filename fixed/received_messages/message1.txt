â€œWhat is it you are afraid of, Lise? I donâ€™t understand,â€ said he.

â€œThere, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone in the country.â€

â€œWith my father and sister, remember,â€ said Prince Andrew gently.

â€œAlone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to be afraid.â€

Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the gist of the matter lay in that.

â€œI still canâ€™t understand what you are afraid of,â€ said Prince Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.

The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.

â€œNo, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have....â€™

â€œMon Dieu, mon Dieu!â€ she muttered, and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.

â€œGood night, Lise,â€ said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger.

CHAPTER VIII
The friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand.

â€œLet us go and have supper,â€ he said with a sigh, going to the door.

They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room. Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married. Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and, with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on his face, began to talkâ€”as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out.

â€œNever, never marry, my dear fellow! Thatâ€™s my advice: never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of, and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothingâ€”or all that is good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles. Yes! Yes! Yes! Donâ€™t look at me with such surprise. If you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot!... But whatâ€™s the good?...â€ and he waved his arm.

Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend in amazement.

â€œMy wife,â€ continued Prince Andrew, â€œis an excellent woman, one of those rare women with whom a manâ€™s honor is safe; but, O God, what would I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to whom I mention this, because I like you.â€

As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that BolkÃ³nski who had lolled in Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s easy chairs and with half-closed eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant light. It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation.

â€œYou donâ€™t understand why I say this,â€ he continued, â€œbut it is the whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career,â€ said he (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), â€œbut Bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing but his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself up with a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and trivialityâ€”these are the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I am now going to the war, the greatest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic wit,â€ continued Prince Andrew, â€œand at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s they listen to me. And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women.... If you only knew what those society women are, and women in general! My father is right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everythingâ€”thatâ€™s what women are when you see them in their true colors! When you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them, but thereâ€™s nothing, nothing, nothing! No, donâ€™t marry, my dear fellow; donâ€™t marry!â€ concluded Prince Andrew.

â€œIt seems funny to me,â€ said Pierre, â€œthat you, you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have everything before you, everything. And you....â€

He did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.

â€œHow can he talk like that?â€ thought Pierre. He considered his friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might be best described as strength of will. Pierre was always astonished at Prince Andrewâ€™s calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything, and had an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for work and study. And if Pierre was often struck by Andrewâ€™s lack of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he himself was particularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength.

Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly.

â€œMy part is played out,â€ said Prince Andrew. â€œWhatâ€™s the use of talking about me? Let us talk about you,â€ he added after a silence, smiling at his reassuring thoughts.

That smile was immediately reflected on Pierreâ€™s face.

â€œBut what is there to say about me?â€ said Pierre, his face relaxing into a careless, merry smile. â€œWhat am I? An illegitimate son!â€ He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this. â€œWithout a name and without means... And it really...â€ But he did not say what â€œit reallyâ€ was. â€œFor the present I am free and am all right. Only I havenâ€™t the least idea what I am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously.â€

Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glanceâ€”friendly and affectionate as it wasâ€”expressed a sense of his own superiority.

â€œI am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among our whole set. Yes, youâ€™re all right! Choose what you will; itâ€™s all the same. Youâ€™ll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up visiting those KurÃ¡gins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so badlyâ€”all this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!â€

â€œWhat would you have, my dear fellow?â€ answered Pierre, shrugging his shoulders. â€œWomen, my dear fellow; women!â€

â€œI donâ€™t understand it,â€ replied Prince Andrew. â€œWomen who are comme il faut, thatâ€™s a different matter; but the KurÃ¡ginsâ€™ set of women, â€˜women and wineâ€™ I donâ€™t understand!â€

Pierre was staying at Prince VasÃ­li KurÃ¡ginâ€™s and sharing the dissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to Prince Andrewâ€™s sister.

â€œDo you know?â€ said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy thought, â€œseriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading such a life I canâ€™t decide or think properly about anything. Oneâ€™s head aches, and one spends all oneâ€™s money. He asked me for tonight, but I wonâ€™t go.â€

â€œYou give me your word of honor not to go?â€

â€œOn my honor!â€

CHAPTER IX
It was past one oâ€™clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night. On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole KurÃ¡gin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which there was generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of.

â€œI should like to go to KurÃ¡ginâ€™s,â€ thought he.

But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go there. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it he had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering; â€œbesides,â€ thought he, â€œall such â€˜words of honorâ€™ are conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same!â€ Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying all his decisions and intentions. He went to KurÃ¡ginâ€™s.

Reaching the large house near the Horse Guardsâ€™ barracks, in which Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs, and went in at the open door. There was no one in the anteroom; empty bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance.

Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed. Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses. From the third room came sounds of laughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and general commotion. Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window. Three others were romping with a young bear, one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others.

â€œI bet a hundred on Stevens!â€ shouted one.

â€œMind, no holding on!â€ cried another.

â€œI bet on DÃ³lokhov!â€ cried a third. â€œKurÃ¡gin, you part our hands.â€

â€œThere, leave Bruin alone; hereâ€™s a bet on.â€

â€œAt one draught, or he loses!â€ shouted a fourth.

â€œJacob, bring a bottle!â€ shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine linen shirt unfastened in front. â€œWait a bit, you fellows.... Here is PÃ©tya! Good man!â€ cried he, addressing Pierre.

Another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes, particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring, cried from the window: â€œCome here; part the bets!â€ This was DÃ³lokhov, an officer of the SemÃ«nov regiment, a notorious gambler and duelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about him merrily.

â€œI donâ€™t understand. Whatâ€™s it all about?â€

â€œWait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here,â€ said Anatole, and taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.

â€œFirst of all you must drink!â€

Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening to their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierreâ€™s glass while explaining that DÃ³lokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.

â€œGo on, you must drink it all,â€ said Anatole, giving Pierre the last glass, â€œor I wonâ€™t let you go!â€

â€œNo, I wonâ€™t,â€ said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up to the window.

DÃ³lokhov was holding the Englishmanâ€™s hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to Anatole and Pierre.

DÃ³lokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. He was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache, so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face. DÃ³lokhov was a man of small means and no connections. Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles, DÃ³lokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them, including Anatole himself, respected him more than they did Anatole. DÃ³lokhov could play all games and nearly always won. However much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness. Both KurÃ¡gin and DÃ³lokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg.

The bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around.

Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted to smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but could not move it. He smashed a pane.

â€œYou have a try, Hercules,â€ said he, turning to Pierre.

Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with a crash.

â€œTake it right out, or theyâ€™ll think Iâ€™m holding on,â€ said DÃ³lokhov.

â€œIs the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?â€ said Anatole.

â€œFirst-rate,â€ said Pierre, looking at DÃ³lokhov, who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.

DÃ³lokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window sill. â€œListen!â€ cried he, standing there and addressing those in the room. All were silent.

â€œI bet fifty imperialsâ€â€”he spoke French that the Englishman might understand him, but he did not speak it very wellâ€”â€œI bet fifty imperials ... or do you wish to make it a hundred?â€ added he, addressing the Englishman.

â€œNo, fifty,â€ replied the latter.

â€œAll right. Fifty imperials ... that I will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this spotâ€ (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window) â€œand without holding on to anything. Is that right?â€

â€œQuite right,â€ said the Englishman.

Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at himâ€”the Englishman was shortâ€”began repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.

â€œWait!â€ cried DÃ³lokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention. â€œWait a bit, KurÃ¡gin. Listen! If anyone else does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you understand?â€

The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and though he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating DÃ³lokhovâ€™s words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window sill, leaned over, and looked down.

â€œOh! Oh! Oh!â€ he muttered, looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement.

â€œShut up!â€ cried DÃ³lokhov, pushing him away from the window. The lad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.

Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily, DÃ³lokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill, though it was already quite light. DÃ³lokhovâ€™s back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit up from both sides. Everyone crowded to the window, the Englishman in front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man, older than the others present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of DÃ³lokhovâ€™s shirt.

â€œI say, this is folly! Heâ€™ll be killed,â€ said this more sensible man.

Anatole stopped him.

â€œDonâ€™t touch him! Youâ€™ll startle him and then heâ€™ll be killed. Eh?... What then?... Eh?â€

DÃ³lokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged himself on his seat.

â€œIf anyone comes meddling again,â€ said he, emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips, â€œI will throw him down there. Now then!â€

Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from DÃ³lokhovâ€™s back. Anatole stood erect with staring eyes. The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear. All were still. Pierre took his hands from his eyes. DÃ³lokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort. The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back. â€œWhy is it so long?â€ thought Pierre. It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed. Suddenly DÃ³lokhov made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and arm wavered still more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch the window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never open them again. Suddenly he was aware of a stir all around. He looked up: DÃ³lokhov was standing on the window sill, with a pale but radiant face.

â€œItâ€™s empty.â€

He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly. DÃ³lokhov jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.

â€œWell done!... Fine fellow!... Thereâ€™s a bet for you!... Devil take you!â€ came from different sides.

The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money. DÃ³lokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon the window sill.

â€œGentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? Iâ€™ll do the same thing!â€ he suddenly cried. â€œEven without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a bottle. Iâ€™ll do it.... Bring a bottle!â€

â€œLet him do it, let him do it,â€ said DÃ³lokhov, smiling.

â€œWhat next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why, you go giddy even on a staircase,â€ exclaimed several voices.

â€œIâ€™ll drink it! Letâ€™s have a bottle of rum!â€ shouted Pierre, banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window.

They seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flying.

â€œNo, youâ€™ll never manage him that way,â€ said Anatole. â€œWait a bit and Iâ€™ll get round him.... Listen! Iâ€™ll take your bet tomorrow, but now we are all going to â€”â€”â€™s.â€

â€œCome on then,â€ cried Pierre. â€œCome on!... And weâ€™ll take Bruin with us.â€

And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground, and began dancing round the room with it.

CHAPTER X
Prince VasÃ­li kept the promise he had given to Princess DrubetskÃ¡ya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son BorÃ­s on the evening of Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s soiree. The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an exception made, and BorÃ­s transferred into the regiment of SemÃ«nov Guards with the rank of cornet. He received, however, no appointment to KutÃºzovâ€™s staff despite all Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâ€™s endeavors and entreaties. Soon after Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s reception Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the RostÃ³vs, with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling BÃ³ry, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time. The Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had remained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to RadzivÃ­lov.

It was St. Nataliaâ€™s day and the name day of two of the RostÃ³vsâ€”the mother and the youngest daughterâ€”both named Nataly. Ever since the morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually, bringing visitors to the Countess RostÃ³vaâ€™s big house on the PovarskÃ¡ya, so well known to all Moscow. The countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in relays.

The countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental type of face, evidently worn out with childbearingâ€”she had had twelve. A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna DrubetskÃ¡ya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors. The young people were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors. The count met the guests and saw them off, inviting them all to dinner.

â€œI am very, very grateful to you, mon cher,â€ or â€œma chÃ¨reâ€â€”he called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone, â€œmy dear,â€ whether they were above or below him in rankâ€”â€œI thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended, ma chÃ¨re! On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come, mon cher!â€ These words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation, and with the same expression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven face, the same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows. As soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and fro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or touched on questions of health, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but self-confident French; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner. Sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall, where tables were being set out for eighty people; and looking at the footmen, who were bringing in silver and china, moving tables, and unfolding damask table linen, he would call DmÃ­tri VasÃ­levich, a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say: â€œWell, DmÃ­tri, youâ€™ll see that things are all as they should be? Thatâ€™s right! The great thing is the serving, thatâ€™s it.â€ And with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room.

â€œMÃ¡rya LvÃ³vna KarÃ¡gina and her daughter!â€ announced the countessâ€™ gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing room. The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her husbandâ€™s portrait on it.

â€œIâ€™m quite worn out by these callers. However, Iâ€™ll see her and no more. She is so affected. Ask her in,â€ she said to the footman in a sad voice, as if saying: â€œVery well, finish me off.â€

A tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.

â€œDear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child ... at the RazumÃ³vskiâ€™s ball ... and Countess AprÃ¡ksina ... I was so delighted...â€ came the sounds of animated feminine voices, interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs. Then one of those conversations began which last out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say, â€œI am so delighted... Mammaâ€™s health... and Countess AprÃ¡ksina...â€ and then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, put on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The conversation was on the chief topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of Catherineâ€™s day, Count BezÃºkhov, and about his illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s reception.

â€œI am so sorry for the poor count,â€ said the visitor. â€œHe is in such bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him!â€

â€œWhat is that?â€ asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of Count BezÃºkhovâ€™s distress some fifteen times.

â€œThatâ€™s what comes of a modern education,â€ exclaimed the visitor. â€œIt seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the police.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t say so!â€ replied the countess.

â€œHe chose his friends badly,â€ interposed Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. â€œPrince VasÃ­liâ€™s son, he, and a certain DÃ³lokhov have, it is said, been up to heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it. DÃ³lokhov has been degraded to the ranks and BezÃºkhovâ€™s son sent back to Moscow. Anatole KurÃ¡ginâ€™s father managed somehow to get his sonâ€™s affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg.â€

â€œBut what have they been up to?â€ asked the countess.

â€œThey are regular brigands, especially DÃ³lokhov,â€ replied the visitor. â€œHe is a son of MÃ¡rya IvÃ¡novna DÃ³lokhova, such a worthy woman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere, put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The police tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka Canal. And there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back!â€

â€œWhat a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!â€ shouted the count, dying with laughter.

â€œOh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?â€

Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.

â€œIt was all they could do to rescue the poor man,â€ continued the visitor. â€œAnd to think it is Cyril VladÃ­mirovich BezÃºkhovâ€™s son who amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so well educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education has done for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in spite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite declined: I have my daughters to consider.â€

â€œWhy do you say this young man is so rich?â€ asked the countess, turning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention. â€œHis children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also is illegitimate.â€

The visitor made a gesture with her hand.

â€œI should think he has a score of them.â€

Princess Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna intervened in the conversation, evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society.

â€œThe fact of the matter is,â€ said she significantly, and also in a half whisper, â€œeveryone knows Count Cyrilâ€™s reputation.... He has lost count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.â€

â€œHow handsome the old man still was only a year ago!â€ remarked the countess. â€œI have never seen a handsomer man.â€

â€œHe is very much altered now,â€ said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. â€œWell, as I was saying, Prince VasÃ­li is the next heir through his wife, but the count is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to the Emperor about him; so that in the case of his deathâ€”and he is so ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from Petersburgâ€”no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre or Prince VasÃ­li. Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know it all very well for Prince VasÃ­li told me himself. Besides, Cyril VladÃ­mirovich is my motherâ€™s second cousin. Heâ€™s also my BÃ³ryâ€™s godfather,â€ she added, as if she attached no importance at all to the fact.

â€œPrince VasÃ­li arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on some inspection business,â€ remarked the visitor.

â€œYes, but between ourselves,â€ said the princess, â€œthat is a pretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril VladÃ­mirovich, hearing how ill he is.â€

â€œBut do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke,â€ said the count; and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to the young ladies. â€œI can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut!â€

And as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who always eats well and, in particular, drinks well. â€œSo do come and dine with us!â€ he said.

CHAPTER XI
Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably, but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their leave. The visitorâ€™s daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock, darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It was evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far. Behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short jacket.

The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in.

â€œAh, here she is!â€ he exclaimed laughing. â€œMy pet, whose name day it is. My dear pet!â€

â€œMa chÃ¨re, there is a time for everything,â€ said the countess with feigned severity. â€œYou spoil her, IlyÃ¡,â€ she added, turning to her husband.

â€œHow do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name day,â€ said the visitor. â€œWhat a charming child,â€ she added, addressing the mother.

This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of lifeâ€”with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippersâ€”was just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not yet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her motherâ€™s mantillaâ€”not paying the least attention to her severe remarkâ€”and began to laugh. She laughed, and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the folds of her frock.

â€œDo you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...â€ was all NatÃ¡sha managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even the prim visitor could not help joining in.

â€œNow then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,â€ said the mother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning to the visitor she added: â€œShe is my youngest girl.â€

NatÃ¡sha, raising her face for a moment from her motherâ€™s mantilla, glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.

The visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it necessary to take some part in it.

â€œTell me, my dear,â€ said she to NatÃ¡sha, â€œis Mimi a relation of yours? A daughter, I suppose?â€

NatÃ¡sha did not like the visitorâ€™s tone of condescension to childish things. She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.

Meanwhile the younger generation: BorÃ­s, the officer, Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâ€™s son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the countâ€™s eldest son; SÃ³nya, the countâ€™s fifteen-year-old niece, and little PÃ©tya, his youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently in the back rooms, from which they had dashed out so impetuously, the conversation had been more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals, the weather, and Countess AprÃ¡ksina. Now and then they glanced at one another, hardly able to suppress their laughter.

The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood, were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike. BorÃ­s was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression. Dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room. He evidently tried to find something to say, but failed. BorÃ­s on the contrary at once found his footing, and related quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged during the five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked right across the skull. Having said this he glanced at NatÃ¡sha. She turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother, who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and unable to control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry her. BorÃ­s did not laugh.

â€œYou were meaning to go out, werenâ€™t you, Mamma? Do you want the carriage?â€ he asked his mother with a smile.

â€œYes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready,â€ she answered, returning his smile.

BorÃ­s quietly left the room and went in search of NatÃ¡sha. The plump boy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been disturbed.

CHAPTER XII
The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the young lady visitor and the countessâ€™ eldest daughter (who was four years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person), were Nicholas and SÃ³nya, the niece. SÃ³nya was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck. By the grace of her movements, by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a pretty, half-grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat. She evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could, like NatÃ¡sha and BorÃ­s, escape from the drawing room.

â€œAh yes, my dear,â€ said the count, addressing the visitor and pointing to Nicholas, â€œhis friend BorÃ­s has become an officer, and so for friendshipâ€™s sake he is leaving the university and me, his old father, and entering the military service, my dear. And there was a place and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department! Isnâ€™t that friendship?â€ remarked the count in an inquiring tone.

â€œBut they say that war has been declared,â€ replied the visitor.

â€œTheyâ€™ve been saying so a long while,â€ said the count, â€œand theyâ€™ll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it. My dear, thereâ€™s friendship for you,â€ he repeated. â€œHeâ€™s joining the hussars.â€

The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.

â€œItâ€™s not at all from friendship,â€ declared Nicholas, flaring up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. â€œIt is not from friendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation.â€

He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were both regarding him with a smile of approbation.

â€œSchubert, the colonel of the PÃ¡vlograd Hussars, is dining with us today. He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him. It canâ€™t be helped!â€ said the count, shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.

â€œI have already told you, Papa,â€ said his son, â€œthat if you donâ€™t wish to let me go, Iâ€™ll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere except in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.â€”I donâ€™t know how to hide what I feel.â€ As he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at SÃ³nya and the young lady visitor.

The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.

â€œAll right, all right!â€ said the old count. â€œHe always flares up! This Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he rose from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,â€ he added, not noticing his visitorâ€™s sarcastic smile.

The elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie KarÃ¡gina turned to young RostÃ³v.

â€œWhat a pity you werenâ€™t at the ArkhÃ¡rovsâ€™ on Thursday. It was so dull without you,â€ said she, giving him a tender smile.

The young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of SÃ³nya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk he glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry glance, and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips, she got up and left the room. All Nicholasâ€™ animation vanished. He waited for the first pause in the conversation, and then with a distressed face left the room to find SÃ³nya.

â€œHow plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves!â€ said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out. â€œCousinageâ€”dangereux voisinage,â€ * she added.

* Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.

â€œYes,â€ said the countess when the brightness these young people had brought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question no one had put but which was always in her mind, â€œand how much suffering, how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy. One is always, always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both for girls and boys.â€

â€œIt all depends on the bringing up,â€ remarked the visitor.

â€œYes, youâ€™re quite right,â€ continued the countess. â€œTill now I have always, thank God, been my childrenâ€™s friend and had their full confidence,â€ said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets from them. â€œI know I shall always be my daughtersâ€™ first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with his impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy canâ€™t help it), he will all the same never be like those Petersburg young men.â€

â€œYes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,â€ chimed in the count, who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that everything was splendid. â€œJust fancy: wants to be an hussar. Whatâ€™s one to do, my dear?â€

â€œWhat a charming creature your younger girl is,â€ said the visitor; â€œa little volcano!â€

â€œYes, a regular volcano,â€ said the count. â€œTakes after me! And what a voice she has; though sheâ€™s my daughter, I tell the truth when I say sheâ€™ll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an Italian to give her lessons.â€

â€œIsnâ€™t she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train it at that age.â€

â€œOh no, not at all too young!â€ replied the count. â€œWhy, our mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.â€

â€œAnd sheâ€™s in love with BorÃ­s already. Just fancy!â€ said the countess with a gentle smile, looking at BorÃ­s and went on, evidently concerned with a thought that always occupied her: â€œNow you see if I were to be severe with her and to forbid it ... goodness knows what they might be up to on the slyâ€ (she meant that they would be kissing), â€œbut as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come running to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I spoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister I was stricter.â€

â€œYes, I was brought up quite differently,â€ remarked the handsome elder daughter, Countess VÃ©ra, with a smile.

But the smile did not enhance VÃ©raâ€™s beauty as smiles generally do; on the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant, expression. VÃ©ra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyoneâ€”the visitors and countess alikeâ€”turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it, and they all felt awkward.

â€œPeople are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them,â€ said the visitor.

â€œWhatâ€™s the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too clever with VÃ©ra,â€ said the count. â€œWell, what of that? Sheâ€™s turned out splendidly all the same,â€ he added, winking at VÃ©ra.

The guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to dinner.

â€œWhat manners! I thought they would never go,â€ said the countess, when she had seen her guests out.
