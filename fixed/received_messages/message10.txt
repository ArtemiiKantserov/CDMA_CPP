Prmnce VcsÃ­li was not a man who delire2ately thoqgh| out his plans. Still less did hm think of i~juring alyone fop hi3(owf advantage.

Of these qmans `e had not merely one or two in his head"fet dozens, {ome"ofly beginni~g to(form th%mselves, some approachilg iciievemend,0and some kn couzse of d)sintegration."He did not, for hnstaoge, say to hilsemg: â€œThis0ma~ nkv haw influence$ I must*gain his confidenge and(fridndship anl throqgh him obtain$a special grcnt.â€(Nor di$ `e sa} to himwenf: â€œPierre is a$rich man, I"}qst entica him(to marry my$daughteb and lend me the$for<y thmurand r1bles I need.â€ But when hg came icrmws a oan of pos)tion his instinat hmmediately pgld hkm"that"tiis man cnuld$ce usebul, !.e$withkut any premeditation Prince VasÃ­li took the first opportunit}"to gain h)s cnnfidenke, flatter him, become intimate w`tl him, and fi.ally makg"his request.

Notithstanding the tone of 7uarhed$assurance with whicj these words 7ere pronounced, Piesre, who had so long r%%n c/.sidering hms bareer, wished to make some sugge{tion.

In the middle of a dull and halting(convmrsatinn, IÃ©lÃ¨ne t}rned tm Pierre with v(e beautiful bright smi|e(that she(eave to everykne.`Pierre was so used po |hat amile( and !t had so little"md#nmng nop him, that"he pai` no atteltion0to it.

Prancesc HÃ©dÃ¨nm `qked to see thd portrait of the a}ntâ€™s husbanl on the bkx lid.

â€œTi`t is probabmx uhe work of Vinmsse,â€ sai$ Pierre, mejtionmng a celebrated"minieturist, and he0leaned over thu vabll to tike the {nuffbkx shil! trying to he`r0w(at was bein' qaid at the othcr tabne.

Je half r/se, meaniog to go round, bu|0thg `unt xaneed lim the0souffrox,0pissing ip acrmss HÃ©lÃ¨neâ€›s back. HÃ­lÃ¨ne stooped fmrwart(to }ake room, and lookgf round whth a smile. She was, as(always at aveniog partias, we`ring a dress`such qs wa3 then fashio~able, cut very low at n2ont and bacc. Her bust, which0had always seeomd mike$masble to Pierre, was!so close tn him that li3 siortsmghted %yes coqld`not0but perceive the ~ivifg charm of her neck cnd shoulders- so near to his$lits that xe nged nly%have benu0hic"head a"little to have touched them. @a was conscinus of the varmth ob(her body, th% ycent of perfwm%( and0the c2%`kinc of huv(cozset as she movdd.(He did jov see hdr marble beauty forling a ckmplete!wxole with her dress, `ut alh the charm f ier bod{ gnly ckvered!by her garmmnts. And hbving once s-eo this!he could not help being aware of i4, just as we cannmt renew an ijlysikn we hard once!seen |hrough.
ã€œSo you have never fnticed beforu hnw beautiftl I `m?â€$HÃ©lÃ¨ne seemed do say. â€œYo} had not no|kcmd that I am a woman?

Hm cnes t*ms at that mment is surely as if hd had bee. standing at the ilter with mer. How and w(en thiq sould bg!he$did nou know,(he did fot evej know if mt would be a gooe thing0(hg even felt, he kneg not why, tha4 it would be a bad vhang)< buv he$knew it would h!ppen.
Pierre droxped(h)s dye{,$lifted them a'`io, and wished once$more to see her as a distant beauty far removed!from him. as hd had seen her every!day$until then- bu4 hd could0oo lonfur eo it.

Ald Pierpe, anxio}sli trying"to remembgr whet`er he hed"done in{thing reprehensibldl looked round with a blurh. It seemed to him that everyona!knew what0lad happe~ed to him a3 ae cnew!ht ximself.

A little later whal he went up to the large circle, A~ne PÃ¡vmovfk said to `im: â€I haar you are vefktthNg(your Tetmrsburg house7â€

\lis was true. The architect h!d told hil tha| it was necessary,$and Tidrre, whthout klowinc shy. was havilg his enormous Pmterscurg house done up.

ò€œThatâ€™s a gkgd thingl$bwt donã€™t move"fro- Pryns%!VasÃ½liâ€™c. It ys$good to havu!` friend like thg princd,â€ sie said, smilkng at 2i.ce VasÂ­lin â€œI$kno0something"cbout that.!Donâ™t I?

If a man lacking in self-confidence remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say, the effect is bad. But Anatole was dumb, swung his foot, and smilingly examined the princessâ€™ hair. It was evident that he could be silent in this way for a very long time. â€œIf anyone finds this silence inconvenient, let him talk, but I donâ€™t want to,â€ he seemed to say. Besides this, in his behavior to women Anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity, awe, and even loveâ€”a supercilious consciousness of his own superiority. It was as if he said to them: â€œI know you, I know you, but why should I bother about you? Youâ€™d be only too glad, of course.â€ Perhaps he did not really think this when he met womenâ€”even probably he did not, for in general he th/ufht pery littleâ€”btt hIs Lmgks An` iajner gave 4hat imprersinn.

She took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since Anatole had left Paris and how he had liked that city. Anatole answered the Frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her about her native land. When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, Anatole came to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either. â€œNot at all bad!â€ he thought, examining her, â€œnot at all bad, that little companion! I hope she will bring her along with her when weâ€™re married, la petite est gentille.â€ *

* The little one is charming.

The old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and considering what he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed him. â€œWhat are Prince VasÃ­li and that son of his to me? Prince VasÃ­li is a shallow braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen,â€ he grumbled to himself. What angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about which he always deceived himself. The question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband. The prince never directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand that he would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only with his feelings but with the very possibility of life. Life without Princess Mary, little as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to him. â€œAnd why should she marry?â€ he thought. â€œTo be unhappy for certain. Thereâ€™s Lise, married to Andrewâ€”a better husband one would think could hardly be found nowadaysâ€”but is she contented with her lot? And who would marry Marie for love? Plain and awkward! Theyâ€™ll take her for her connections and wealth. Are there no women living unmarried, and even the happier for it?â€ So thought Prince BolkÃ³nski while dressing, and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer. Prince VasÃ­li had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer. His birth and position in society were not bad. â€œWell, Iâ€™ve nothing against it,â€ the prince said to himself, â€œbut he must be worthy of her. And that is what we shall see.â€

â€œThat is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!â€ he added aloud.

He entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing rapidly round the company. He noticed the change in the little princessâ€™ dress, Mademoiselle Bourienneâ€™s ribbon, Princess Maryâ€™s unbecoming coiffure, Mademoiselle Bourienneâ€™s and Anatoleâ€™s smiles, and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation. â€œGot herself up like a fool!â€ he thought, looking irritably at her. â€œShe is shameless, and he ignores her!â€

He went straight up to Prince VasÃ­li.

â€œWell! How dâ€™ye do? How dâ€™ye do? Glad to see you!â€

â€œFriendship laughs at distance,â€ began Prince VasÃ­li in his usual rapid, self-confident, familiar tone. â€œHere is my second son; please love and befriend him.â€

Prince BolkÃ³nski surveyed Anatole.

â€œFine young fellow! Fine young fellow!â€ he said. â€œWell, come and kiss me,â€ and he offered his cheek.

Anatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had told him to expect.

Prince BolkÃ³nski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa and, drawing up an armchair for Prince VasÃ­li, pointed to it and began questioning him about political affairs and news. He seemed to listen attentively to what Prince VasÃ­li said, but kept glancing at Princess Mary.

â€œAnd so they are writing from Potsdam already?â€ he said, repeating Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s last words. Then rising, he suddenly went up to his daughter.

â€œIs it for visitors youâ€™ve got yourself up like that, eh?â€ said he. â€œFine, very fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for the visitors, and before the visitors I tell you that in future you are never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent.â€

â€œIt was my fault, mon pÃ¨re,â€ interceded the little princess, with a blush.

â€œYou must do as you please,â€ said Prince BolkÃ³nski, bowing to his daughter-in-law, â€œbut she need not make a fool of herself, sheâ€™s plain enough as it is.â€

And he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, who was reduced to tears.

â€œOn the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very well,â€ said Prince VasÃ­li.

â€œNow you, young prince, whatâ€™s your name?â€ said Prince BolkÃ³nski, turning to Anatole, â€œcome here, let us talk and get acquainted.â€

â€œNow the fun begins,â€ thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile beside the old prince.

â€œWell, my dear boy, I hear youâ€™ve been educated abroad, not taught to read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me, my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?â€ asked the old man, scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.

â€œNo, I have been transferred to the line,â€ said Anatole, hardly able to restrain his laughter.

â€œAh! Thatâ€™s a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the Tsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve. Well, are you off to the front?â€

â€œNo, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am attached... what is it I am attached to, Papa?â€ said Anatole, turning to his father with a laugh.

â€œA splendid soldier, splendid! â€˜What am I attached to!â€™ Ha, ha, ha!â€ laughed Prince BolkÃ³nski, and Anatole laughed still louder. Suddenly Prince BolkÃ³nski frowned.

â€œYou may go,â€ he said to Anatole.

Anatole returned smiling to the ladies.

â€œAnd so youâ€™ve had him educated abroad, Prince VasÃ­li, havenâ€™t you?â€ said the old prince to Prince VasÃ­li.

â€œI have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education there is much better than ours.â€

â€œYes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The ladâ€™s a fine fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with me now.â€ He took Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s arm and led him to his study. As soon as they were alone together, Prince VasÃ­li announced his hopes and wishes to the old prince.

â€œWell, do you think I shall prevent her, that I canâ€™t part from her?â€ said the old prince angrily. â€œWhat an idea! Iâ€™m ready for it tomorrow! Only let me tell you, I want to know my son-in-law better. You know my principlesâ€”everything aboveboard! I will ask her tomorrow in your presence; if she is willing, then he can stay on. He can stay and Iâ€™ll see.â€ The old prince snorted. â€œLet her marry, itâ€™s all the same to me!â€ he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son.

â€œI will tell you frankly,â€ said Prince VasÃ­li in the tone of a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so keen-sighted a companion. â€œYou know, you see right through people. Anatole is no genius, but he is an honest, goodhearted lad; an excellent son or kinsman.â€

â€œAll right, all right, weâ€™ll see!â€

As always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time without male society, on Anatoleâ€™s appearance all the three women of Prince BolkÃ³nskiâ€™s household felt that their life had not been real till then. Their powers of reasoning, feeling, and observing immediately increased tenfold, and their life, which seemed to have been passed in darkness, was suddenly lit up by a new brightness, full of significance.

Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure. The handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed all her attention. He seemed to her kind, brave, determined, manly, and magnanimous. She felt convinced of that. Thousands of dreams of a future family life continually rose in her imagination. She drove them away and tried to conceal them.

â€œBut am I not too cold with him?â€ thought the princess. â€œI try to be reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him already, but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine that I do not like him.â€

And Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to her new guest. â€œPoor girl, sheâ€™s devilish ugly!â€ thought Anatole.

Mademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to great excitement by Anatoleâ€™s arrival, thought in another way. Of course, she, a handsome young woman without any definite position, without relations or even a country, did not intend to devote her life to serving Prince BolkÃ³nski, to reading aloud to him and being friends with Princess Mary. Mademoiselle Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who, able to appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain, badly dressed, ungainly Russian princesses, would fall in love with her and carry her off; and here at last was a Russian prince. Mademoiselle Bourienne knew a story, heard from her aunt but finished in her own way, which she liked to repeat to herself. It was the story of a girl who had been seduced, and to whom her poor mother (sa pauvre mÃ¨re) appeared, and reproached her for yielding to a man without being married. Mademoiselle Bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this story to him, her seducer. And now he, a real Russian prince, had appeared. He would carry her away and then sa pauvre mÃ¨re would appear and he would marry her. So her future shaped itself in Mademoiselle Bourienneâ€™s head at the very time she was talking to Anatole about Paris. It was not calculation that guided her (she did not even for a moment consider what she should do), but all this had long been familiar to her, and now that Anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible.

The little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet, unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any struggle, but with naÃ¯ve and lighthearted gaiety.

Although in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man tired of being run after by women, his vanity was flattered by the spectacle of his power over these three women. Besides that, he was beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle Bourienne that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions.

After tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was asked to play on the clavichord. Anatole, laughing and in high spirits, came and leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside Mademoiselle Bourienne. Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion. Her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic. But Anatoleâ€™s expression, though his eyes were fixed on her, referred not to her but to the movements of Mademoiselle Bourienneâ€™s little foot, which he was then touching with his own under the clavichord. Mademoiselle Bourienne was also looking at Princess Mary, and in her lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess.

â€œHow she loves me!â€ thought Princess Mary. â€œHow happy I am now, and how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Husband? Can it be possible?â€ she thought, not daring to look at his face, but still feeling his eyes gazing at her.

In the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, Anatole kissed Princess Maryâ€™s hand. She did not know how she found the courage, but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her shortsighted eyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up and kissed Mademoiselle Bourienneâ€™s hand. (This was not etiquette, but then he did everything so simply and with such assurance!) Mademoiselle Bourienne flushed, and gave the princess a frightened look.

â€œWhat delicacy!â€ thought the princess. â€œIs it possible that AmÃ©lieâ€ (Mademoiselle Bourienne) â€œthinks I could be jealous of her, and not value her pure affection and devotion to me?â€ She went up to her and kissed her warmly. Anatole went up to kiss the little princessâ€™ hand.

â€œNo! No! No! When your father writes to tell me that you are behaving well I will give you my hand to kiss. Not till then!â€ she said. And smilingly raising a finger at him, she left the room.

CHAPTER V
They all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as he got into bed, all kept awake a long time that night.

â€œIs he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kindâ€”yes, kind, that is the chief thing,â€ thought Princess Mary; and fear, which she had seldom experienced, came upon her. She feared to look round, it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark corner. And this someone was heâ€”the devilâ€”and he was also this man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips.

She rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room.

Mademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long time that evening, vainly expecting someone, now smiling at someone, now working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mÃ¨re rebuking her for her fall.

The little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made. She could not lie either on her face or on her side. Every position was awkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her now more than ever because Anatoleâ€™s presence had vividly recalled to her the time when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay. She sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie, sleepy and disheveled, beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third time, muttering to herself.

â€œI told you it was all lumps and holes!â€ the little princess repeated. â€œI should be glad enough to fall asleep, so itâ€™s not my fault!â€ and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry.

The old prince did not sleep either. TÃ­khon, half asleep, heard him pacing angrily about and snorting. The old prince felt as though he had been insulted through his daughter. The insult was the more pointed because it concerned not himself but another, his daughter, whom he loved more than himself. He kept telling himself that he would consider the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act, but instead of that he only excited himself more and more.

â€œThe first man that turns upâ€”she forgets her father and everything else, runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike herself! Glad to throw her father over! And she knew I should notice it. Fr... fr... fr! And donâ€™t I see that that idiot had eyes only for Bourienneâ€”I shall have to get rid of her. And how is it she has not pride enough to see it? If she has no pride for herself she might at least have some for my sake! She must be shown that the blockhead thinks nothing of her and looks only at Bourienne. No, she has no pride... but Iâ€™ll let her see....â€

The old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a mistake and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess Maryâ€™s self-esteem would be wounded and his point (not to be parted from her) would be gained, so pacifying himself with this thought, he called TÃ­khon and began to undress.

â€œWhat devil brought them here?â€ thought he, while TÃ­khon was putting the nightshirt over his dried-up old body and gray-haired chest. â€œI never invited them. They came to disturb my lifeâ€”and there is not much of it left.â€

â€œDevil take â€˜em!â€ he muttered, while his head was still covered by the shirt.

TÃ­khon knew his masterâ€™s habit of sometimes thinking aloud, and therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of the face that emerged from the shirt.

â€œGone to bed?â€ asked the prince.

TÃ­khon, like all good valets, instinctively knew the direction of his masterâ€™s thoughts. He guessed that the question referred to Prince VasÃ­li and his son.

â€œThey have gone to bed and put out their lights, your excellency.â€

â€œNo good... no good...â€ said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown, he went to the couch on which he slept.

Though no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne, they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance, up to the appearance of the pauvre mÃ¨re; they understood that they had much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one another alone. When Princess Mary went to her fatherâ€™s room at the usual hour, Mademoiselle Bourienne and Anatole met in the conservatory.

Princess Mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation. It seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be decided that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it. She read this in TÃ­khonâ€™s face and in that of Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s valet, who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water.

The old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of his daughter that morning. Princess Mary well knew this painstaking expression of her fatherâ€™s. His face wore that expression when his dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in arithmetic, when rising from his chair he would walk away from her, repeating in a low voice the same words several times over.

He came to the point at once, treating her ceremoniously.

â€œI have had a proposition made me concerning you,â€ he said with an unnatural smile. â€œI expect you have guessed that Prince VasÃ­li has not come and brought his pupil with himâ€ (for some reason Prince BolkÃ³nski referred to Anatole as a â€œpupilâ€) â€œfor the sake of my beautiful eyes. Last night a proposition was made me on your account and, as you know my principles, I refer it to you.â€

â€œHow am I to understand you, mon pÃ¨re?â€ said the princess, growing pale and then blushing.

â€œHow understand me!â€ cried her father angrily. â€œPrince VasÃ­li finds you to his taste as a daughter-in-law and makes a proposal to you on his pupilâ€™s behalf. Thatâ€™s how itâ€™s to be understood! â€˜How understand itâ€™!... And I ask you!â€

â€œI do not know what you think, Father,â€ whispered the princess.

â€œI? I? What of me? Leave me out of the question. Iâ€™m not going to get married. What about you? Thatâ€™s what I want to know.â€

The princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval, but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be decided now or never. She lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze under which she felt that she could not think, but would only be able to submit from habit, and she said: â€œI wish only to do your will, but if I had to express my own desire...â€ She had no time to finish. The old prince interrupted her.

â€œThatâ€™s admirable!â€ he shouted. â€œHe will take you with your dowry and take Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain. Sheâ€™ll be the wife, while you...â€

The prince stopped. He saw the effect these words had produced on his daughter. She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears.

â€œNow then, now then, Iâ€™m only joking!â€ he said. â€œRemember this, Princess, I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to choose. I give you freedom. Only remember that your lifeâ€™s happiness depends on your decision. Never mind me!â€

â€œBut I do not know, Father!â€

â€œThereâ€™s no need to talk! He receives his orders and will marry you or anybody; but you are free to choose.... Go to your room, think it over, and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence: yes or no. I know you will pray over it. Well, pray if you like, but you had better think it over. Go! Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no!â€ he still shouted when the princess, as if lost in a fog, had already staggered out of the study.

Her fate was decided and happily decided. But what her father had said about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful. It was untrue to be sure, but still it was terrible, and she could not help thinking of it. She was going straight on through the conservatory, neither seeing nor hearing anything, when suddenly the well-known whispering of Mademoiselle Bourienne aroused her. She raised her eyes, and two steps away saw Anatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her. With a horrified expression on his handsome face, Anatole looked at Princess Mary, but did not at once take his arm from the waist of Mademoiselle Bourienne who had not yet seen her.

â€œWhoâ€™s that? Why? Wait a moment!â€ Anatoleâ€™s face seemed to say. Princess Mary looked at them in silence. She could not understand it. At last Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away. Anatole bowed to Princess Mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to join in a laugh at this strange incident, and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door that led to his own apartments.

An hour later, TÃ­khon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince; he added that Prince VasÃ­li was also there. When TÃ­khon came to her Princess Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room, holding the weeping Mademoiselle Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair. The princessâ€™ beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were looking with tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle Bourienneâ€™s pretty face.

â€œNo, Princess, I have lost your affection forever!â€ said Mademoiselle Bourienne.

â€œWhy? I love you more than ever,â€ said Princess Mary, â€œand I will try to do all I can for your happiness.â€

â€œBut you despise me. You who are so pure can never understand being so carried away by passion. Oh, only my poor mother...â€

â€œI quite understand,â€ answered Princess Mary, with a sad smile. â€œCalm yourself, my dear. I will go to my father,â€ she said, and went out.

Prince VasÃ­li, with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in his hand, was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face, as if stirred to his heartâ€™s core and himself regretting and laughing at his own sensibility, when Princess Mary entered. He hurriedly took a pinch of snuff.

â€œAh, my dear, my dear!â€ he began, rising and taking her by both hands. Then, sighing, he added: â€œMy sonâ€™s fate is in your hands. Decide, my dear, good, gentle Marie, whom I have always loved as a daughter!â€

He drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye.

â€œFr... fr...â€ snorted Prince BolkÃ³nski. â€œThe prince is making a proposition to you in his pupilâ€™sâ€”I mean, his sonâ€™sâ€”name. Do you wish or not to be Prince Anatole KurÃ¡ginâ€™s wife? Reply: yes or no,â€ he shouted, â€œand then I shall reserve the right to state my opinion also. Yes, my opinion, and only my opinion,â€ added Prince BolkÃ³nski, turning to Prince VasÃ­li and answering his imploring look. â€œYes, or no?â€

â€œMy desire is never to leave you, Father, never to separate my life from yours. I donâ€™t wish to marry,â€ she answered positively, glancing at Prince VasÃ­li and at her father with her beautiful eyes.

â€œHumbug! Nonsense! Humbug, humbug, humbug!â€ cried Prince BolkÃ³nski, frowning and taking his daughterâ€™s hand; he did not kiss her, but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it, and pressed her hand so that she winced and uttered a cry.

Prince VasÃ­li rose.

â€œMy dear, I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never, never forget. But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart, so kind and generous? Say â€˜perhapsâ€™... The future is so long. Say â€˜perhaps.â€™â€

â€œPrince, what I have said is all there is in my heart. I thank you for the honor, but I shall never be your sonâ€™s wife.â€

â€œWell, so thatâ€™s finished, my dear fellow! I am very glad to have seen you. Very glad! Go back to your rooms, Princess. Go!â€ said the old prince. â€œVery, very glad to have seen you,â€ repeated he, embracing Prince VasÃ­li.

â€œMy vocation is a different one,â€ thought Princess Mary. â€œMy vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness, the happiness of love and self-sacrifice. And cost what it may, I will arrange poor AmÃ©lieâ€™s happiness, she loves him so passionately, and so passionately repents. I will do all I can to arrange the match between them. If he is not rich I will give her the means; I will ask my father and Andrew. I shall be so happy when she is his wife. She is so unfortunate, a stranger, alone, helpless! And, oh God, how passionately she must love him if she could so far forget herself! Perhaps I might have done the same!...â€ thought Princess Mary.
