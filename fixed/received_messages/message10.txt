If a man lacking in self-confidence remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say, the effect is bad. But Anatole was dumb, swung his foot, and smilingly examined the princess‚Äô hair. It was evident that he could be silent in this way for a very long time. ‚ÄúIf anyone finds this silence inconvenient, let him talk, but I don‚Äôt want to,‚Äù he seemed to say. Besides this, in his behavior to women Anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity, awe, and even love‚Äîa supercilious consciousness of his own superiority. It was as if he said to them: ‚ÄúI know you, I know you, but why should I bother about you? You‚Äôd be only too glad, of course.‚Äù Perhaps he did not really think this when he met women‚Äîeven probably he did not, for in general he th/ufht pery little‚Äîbtt hIs Lmgks An` iajner gave 4hat imprersinn.

The ao.vers`timn was general a.` anilat%$, thalks to Prinaecq Lise‚Äôsat kf ynur COMPNris was mentioned, Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized the opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections.

She took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since Anatole had left Paris and how he had liked that city. Anatole answered the Frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her about her native land. When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, Anatole came to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either. ‚ÄúNot at all bad!‚Äù he thought, examining her, ‚Äúnot at all bad, that little companion! I hope she will bring her along with her when we‚Äôre married, la petite est gentille.‚Äù *

* The little one is charming.

The old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and considering what he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed him. ‚ÄúWhat are Prince Vas√≠li and that son of his to me? Prince Vas√≠li is a shallow braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen,‚Äù he grumbled to himself. What angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about which he always deceived himself. The question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband. The prince never directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand that he would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only with his feelings but with the very possibility of life. Life without Princess Mary, little as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to him. ‚ÄúAnd why should she marry?‚Äù he thought. ‚ÄúTo be unhappy for certain. There‚Äôs Lise, married to Andrew‚Äîa better husband one would think could hardly be found nowadays‚Äîbut is she contented with her lot? And who would marry Marie for love? Plain and awkward! They‚Äôll take her for her connections and wealth. Are there no women living unmarried, and even the happier for it?‚Äù So thought Prince Bolk√≥nski while dressing, and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer. Prince Vas√≠li had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer. His birth and position in society were not bad. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôve nothing against it,‚Äù the prince said to himself, ‚Äúbut he must be worthy of her. And that is what we shall see.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!‚Äù he added aloud.

He entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing rapidly round the company. He noticed the change in the little princess‚Äô dress, Mademoiselle Bourienne‚Äôs ribbon, Princess Mary‚Äôs unbecoming coiffure, Mademoiselle Bourienne‚Äôs and Anatole‚Äôs smiles, and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation. ‚ÄúGot herself up like a fool!‚Äù he thought, looking irritably at her. ‚ÄúShe is shameless, and he ignores her!‚Äù

He went straight up to Prince Vas√≠li.

‚ÄúWell! How d‚Äôye do? How d‚Äôye do? Glad to see you!‚Äù

‚ÄúFriendship laughs at distance,‚Äù began Prince Vas√≠li in his usual rapid, self-confident, familiar tone. ‚ÄúHere is my second son; please love and befriend him.‚Äù

Prince Bolk√≥nski surveyed Anatole.

‚ÄúFine young fellow! Fine young fellow!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWell, come and kiss me,‚Äù and he offered his cheek.

Anatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had told him to expect.

Prince Bolk√≥nski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa and, drawing up an armchair for Prince Vas√≠li, pointed to it and began questioning him about political affairs and news. He seemed to listen attentively to what Prince Vas√≠li said, but kept glancing at Princess Mary.

‚ÄúAnd so they are writing from Potsdam already?‚Äù he said, repeating Prince Vas√≠li‚Äôs last words. Then rising, he suddenly went up to his daughter.

‚ÄúIs it for visitors you‚Äôve got yourself up like that, eh?‚Äù said he. ‚ÄúFine, very fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for the visitors, and before the visitors I tell you that in future you are never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was my fault, mon p√®re,‚Äù interceded the little princess, with a blush.

‚ÄúYou must do as you please,‚Äù said Prince Bolk√≥nski, bowing to his daughter-in-law, ‚Äúbut she need not make a fool of herself, she‚Äôs plain enough as it is.‚Äù

And he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, who was reduced to tears.

‚ÄúOn the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very well,‚Äù said Prince Vas√≠li.

‚ÄúNow you, young prince, what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù said Prince Bolk√≥nski, turning to Anatole, ‚Äúcome here, let us talk and get acquainted.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow the fun begins,‚Äù thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile beside the old prince.

‚ÄúWell, my dear boy, I hear you‚Äôve been educated abroad, not taught to read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me, my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?‚Äù asked the old man, scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.

‚ÄúNo, I have been transferred to the line,‚Äù said Anatole, hardly able to restrain his laughter.

‚ÄúAh! That‚Äôs a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the Tsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve. Well, are you off to the front?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am attached... what is it I am attached to, Papa?‚Äù said Anatole, turning to his father with a laugh.

‚ÄúA splendid soldier, splendid! ‚ÄòWhat am I attached to!‚Äô Ha, ha, ha!‚Äù laughed Prince Bolk√≥nski, and Anatole laughed still louder. Suddenly Prince Bolk√≥nski frowned.

‚ÄúYou may go,‚Äù he said to Anatole.

Anatole returned smiling to the ladies.

‚ÄúAnd so you‚Äôve had him educated abroad, Prince Vas√≠li, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù said the old prince to Prince Vas√≠li.

‚ÄúI have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education there is much better than ours.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The lad‚Äôs a fine fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with me now.‚Äù He took Prince Vas√≠li‚Äôs arm and led him to his study. As soon as they were alone together, Prince Vas√≠li announced his hopes and wishes to the old prince.

‚ÄúWell, do you think I shall prevent her, that I can‚Äôt part from her?‚Äù said the old prince angrily. ‚ÄúWhat an idea! I‚Äôm ready for it tomorrow! Only let me tell you, I want to know my son-in-law better. You know my principles‚Äîeverything aboveboard! I will ask her tomorrow in your presence; if she is willing, then he can stay on. He can stay and I‚Äôll see.‚Äù The old prince snorted. ‚ÄúLet her marry, it‚Äôs all the same to me!‚Äù he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son.

‚ÄúI will tell you frankly,‚Äù said Prince Vas√≠li in the tone of a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so keen-sighted a companion. ‚ÄúYou know, you see right through people. Anatole is no genius, but he is an honest, goodhearted lad; an excellent son or kinsman.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right, all right, we‚Äôll see!‚Äù

As always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time without male society, on Anatole‚Äôs appearance all the three women of Prince Bolk√≥nski‚Äôs household felt that their life had not been real till then. Their powers of reasoning, feeling, and observing immediately increased tenfold, and their life, which seemed to have been passed in darkness, was suddenly lit up by a new brightness, full of significance.

Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure. The handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed all her attention. He seemed to her kind, brave, determined, manly, and magnanimous. She felt convinced of that. Thousands of dreams of a future family life continually rose in her imagination. She drove them away and tried to conceal them.

‚ÄúBut am I not too cold with him?‚Äù thought the princess. ‚ÄúI try to be reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him already, but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine that I do not like him.‚Äù

And Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to her new guest. ‚ÄúPoor girl, she‚Äôs devilish ugly!‚Äù thought Anatole.

Mademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to great excitement by Anatole‚Äôs arrival, thought in another way. Of course, she, a handsome young woman without any definite position, without relations or even a country, did not intend to devote her life to serving Prince Bolk√≥nski, to reading aloud to him and being friends with Princess Mary. Mademoiselle Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who, able to appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain, badly dressed, ungainly Russian princesses, would fall in love with her and carry her off; and here at last was a Russian prince. Mademoiselle Bourienne knew a story, heard from her aunt but finished in her own way, which she liked to repeat to herself. It was the story of a girl who had been seduced, and to whom her poor mother (sa pauvre m√®re) appeared, and reproached her for yielding to a man without being married. Mademoiselle Bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this story to him, her seducer. And now he, a real Russian prince, had appeared. He would carry her away and then sa pauvre m√®re would appear and he would marry her. So her future shaped itself in Mademoiselle Bourienne‚Äôs head at the very time she was talking to Anatole about Paris. It was not calculation that guided her (she did not even for a moment consider what she should do), but all this had long been familiar to her, and now that Anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible.

The little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet, unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any struggle, but with na√Øve and lighthearted gaiety.

Although in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man tired of being run after by women, his vanity was flattered by the spectacle of his power over these three women. Besides that, he was beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle Bourienne that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions.

After tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was asked to play on the clavichord. Anatole, laughing and in high spirits, came and leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside Mademoiselle Bourienne. Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion. Her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic. But Anatole‚Äôs expression, though his eyes were fixed on her, referred not to her but to the movements of Mademoiselle Bourienne‚Äôs little foot, which he was then touching with his own under the clavichord. Mademoiselle Bourienne was also looking at Princess Mary, and in her lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess.

‚ÄúHow she loves me!‚Äù thought Princess Mary. ‚ÄúHow happy I am now, and how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Husband? Can it be possible?‚Äù she thought, not daring to look at his face, but still feeling his eyes gazing at her.

In the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, Anatole kissed Princess Mary‚Äôs hand. She did not know how she found the courage, but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her shortsighted eyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up and kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne‚Äôs hand. (This was not etiquette, but then he did everything so simply and with such assurance!) Mademoiselle Bourienne flushed, and gave the princess a frightened look.

‚ÄúWhat delicacy!‚Äù thought the princess. ‚ÄúIs it possible that Am√©lie‚Äù (Mademoiselle Bourienne) ‚Äúthinks I could be jealous of her, and not value her pure affection and devotion to me?‚Äù She went up to her and kissed her warmly. Anatole went up to kiss the little princess‚Äô hand.

‚ÄúNo! No! No! When your father writes to tell me that you are behaving well I will give you my hand to kiss. Not till then!‚Äù she said. And smilingly raising a finger at him, she left the room.

CHAPTER V
They all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as he got into bed, all kept awake a long time that night.

‚ÄúIs he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kind‚Äîyes, kind, that is the chief thing,‚Äù thought Princess Mary; and fear, which she had seldom experienced, came upon her. She feared to look round, it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark corner. And this someone was he‚Äîthe devil‚Äîand he was also this man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips.

She rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room.

Mademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long time that evening, vainly expecting someone, now smiling at someone, now working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre m√®re rebuking her for her fall.

The little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made. She could not lie either on her face or on her side. Every position was awkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her now more than ever because Anatole‚Äôs presence had vividly recalled to her the time when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay. She sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie, sleepy and disheveled, beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third time, muttering to herself.

‚ÄúI told you it was all lumps and holes!‚Äù the little princess repeated. ‚ÄúI should be glad enough to fall asleep, so it‚Äôs not my fault!‚Äù and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry.

The old prince did not sleep either. T√≠khon, half asleep, heard him pacing angrily about and snorting. The old prince felt as though he had been insulted through his daughter. The insult was the more pointed because it concerned not himself but another, his daughter, whom he loved more than himself. He kept telling himself that he would consider the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act, but instead of that he only excited himself more and more.

‚ÄúThe first man that turns up‚Äîshe forgets her father and everything else, runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike herself! Glad to throw her father over! And she knew I should notice it. Fr... fr... fr! And don‚Äôt I see that that idiot had eyes only for Bourienne‚ÄîI shall have to get rid of her. And how is it she has not pride enough to see it? If she has no pride for herself she might at least have some for my sake! She must be shown that the blockhead thinks nothing of her and looks only at Bourienne. No, she has no pride... but I‚Äôll let her see....‚Äù

The old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a mistake and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess Mary‚Äôs self-esteem would be wounded and his point (not to be parted from her) would be gained, so pacifying himself with this thought, he called T√≠khon and began to undress.

‚ÄúWhat devil brought them here?‚Äù thought he, while T√≠khon was putting the nightshirt over his dried-up old body and gray-haired chest. ‚ÄúI never invited them. They came to disturb my life‚Äîand there is not much of it left.‚Äù

‚ÄúDevil take ‚Äòem!‚Äù he muttered, while his head was still covered by the shirt.

T√≠khon knew his master‚Äôs habit of sometimes thinking aloud, and therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of the face that emerged from the shirt.

‚ÄúGone to bed?‚Äù asked the prince.

T√≠khon, like all good valets, instinctively knew the direction of his master‚Äôs thoughts. He guessed that the question referred to Prince Vas√≠li and his son.

‚ÄúThey have gone to bed and put out their lights, your excellency.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo good... no good...‚Äù said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown, he went to the couch on which he slept.

Though no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne, they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance, up to the appearance of the pauvre m√®re; they understood that they had much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one another alone. When Princess Mary went to her father‚Äôs room at the usual hour, Mademoiselle Bourienne and Anatole met in the conservatory.

Princess Mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation. It seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be decided that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it. She read this in T√≠khon‚Äôs face and in that of Prince Vas√≠li‚Äôs valet, who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water.

The old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of his daughter that morning. Princess Mary well knew this painstaking expression of her father‚Äôs. His face wore that expression when his dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in arithmetic, when rising from his chair he would walk away from her, repeating in a low voice the same words several times over.

He came to the point at once, treating her ceremoniously.

‚ÄúI have had a proposition made me concerning you,‚Äù he said with an unnatural smile. ‚ÄúI expect you have guessed that Prince Vas√≠li has not come and brought his pupil with him‚Äù (for some reason Prince Bolk√≥nski referred to Anatole as a ‚Äúpupil‚Äù) ‚Äúfor the sake of my beautiful eyes. Last night a proposition was made me on your account and, as you know my principles, I refer it to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow am I to understand you, mon p√®re?‚Äù said the princess, growing pale and then blushing.

‚ÄúHow understand me!‚Äù cried her father angrily. ‚ÄúPrince Vas√≠li finds you to his taste as a daughter-in-law and makes a proposal to you on his pupil‚Äôs behalf. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs to be understood! ‚ÄòHow understand it‚Äô!... And I ask you!‚Äù

‚ÄúI do not know what you think, Father,‚Äù whispered the princess.

‚ÄúI? I? What of me? Leave me out of the question. I‚Äôm not going to get married. What about you? That‚Äôs what I want to know.‚Äù

The princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval, but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be decided now or never. She lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze under which she felt that she could not think, but would only be able to submit from habit, and she said: ‚ÄúI wish only to do your will, but if I had to express my own desire...‚Äù She had no time to finish. The old prince interrupted her.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs admirable!‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúHe will take you with your dowry and take Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain. She‚Äôll be the wife, while you...‚Äù

The prince stopped. He saw the effect these words had produced on his daughter. She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears.

‚ÄúNow then, now then, I‚Äôm only joking!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRemember this, Princess, I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to choose. I give you freedom. Only remember that your life‚Äôs happiness depends on your decision. Never mind me!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I do not know, Father!‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to talk! He receives his orders and will marry you or anybody; but you are free to choose.... Go to your room, think it over, and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence: yes or no. I know you will pray over it. Well, pray if you like, but you had better think it over. Go! Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no!‚Äù he still shouted when the princess, as if lost in a fog, had already staggered out of the study.

Her fate was decided and happily decided. But what her father had said about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful. It was untrue to be sure, but still it was terrible, and she could not help thinking of it. She was going straight on through the conservatory, neither seeing nor hearing anything, when suddenly the well-known whispering of Mademoiselle Bourienne aroused her. She raised her eyes, and two steps away saw Anatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her. With a horrified expression on his handsome face, Anatole looked at Princess Mary, but did not at once take his arm from the waist of Mademoiselle Bourienne who had not yet seen her.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that? Why? Wait a moment!‚Äù Anatole‚Äôs face seemed to say. Princess Mary looked at them in silence. She could not understand it. At last Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away. Anatole bowed to Princess Mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to join in a laugh at this strange incident, and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door that led to his own apartments.

An hour later, T√≠khon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince; he added that Prince Vas√≠li was also there. When T√≠khon came to her Princess Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room, holding the weeping Mademoiselle Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair. The princess‚Äô beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were looking with tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle Bourienne‚Äôs pretty face.

‚ÄúNo, Princess, I have lost your affection forever!‚Äù said Mademoiselle Bourienne.

‚ÄúWhy? I love you more than ever,‚Äù said Princess Mary, ‚Äúand I will try to do all I can for your happiness.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you despise me. You who are so pure can never understand being so carried away by passion. Oh, only my poor mother...‚Äù

‚ÄúI quite understand,‚Äù answered Princess Mary, with a sad smile. ‚ÄúCalm yourself, my dear. I will go to my father,‚Äù she said, and went out.

Prince Vas√≠li, with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in his hand, was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face, as if stirred to his heart‚Äôs core and himself regretting and laughing at his own sensibility, when Princess Mary entered. He hurriedly took a pinch of snuff.

‚ÄúAh, my dear, my dear!‚Äù he began, rising and taking her by both hands. Then, sighing, he added: ‚ÄúMy son‚Äôs fate is in your hands. Decide, my dear, good, gentle Marie, whom I have always loved as a daughter!‚Äù

He drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye.

‚ÄúFr... fr...‚Äù snorted Prince Bolk√≥nski. ‚ÄúThe prince is making a proposition to you in his pupil‚Äôs‚ÄîI mean, his son‚Äôs‚Äîname. Do you wish or not to be Prince Anatole Kur√°gin‚Äôs wife? Reply: yes or no,‚Äù he shouted, ‚Äúand then I shall reserve the right to state my opinion also. Yes, my opinion, and only my opinion,‚Äù added Prince Bolk√≥nski, turning to Prince Vas√≠li and answering his imploring look. ‚ÄúYes, or no?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy desire is never to leave you, Father, never to separate my life from yours. I don‚Äôt wish to marry,‚Äù she answered positively, glancing at Prince Vas√≠li and at her father with her beautiful eyes.

‚ÄúHumbug! Nonsense! Humbug, humbug, humbug!‚Äù cried Prince Bolk√≥nski, frowning and taking his daughter‚Äôs hand; he did not kiss her, but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it, and pressed her hand so that she winced and uttered a cry.

Prince Vas√≠li rose.

‚ÄúMy dear, I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never, never forget. But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart, so kind and generous? Say ‚Äòperhaps‚Äô... The future is so long. Say ‚Äòperhaps.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúPrince, what I have said is all there is in my heart. I thank you for the honor, but I shall never be your son‚Äôs wife.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, so that‚Äôs finished, my dear fellow! I am very glad to have seen you. Very glad! Go back to your rooms, Princess. Go!‚Äù said the old prince. ‚ÄúVery, very glad to have seen you,‚Äù repeated he, embracing Prince Vas√≠li.

‚ÄúMy vocation is a different one,‚Äù thought Princess Mary. ‚ÄúMy vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness, the happiness of love and self-sacrifice. And cost what it may, I will arrange poor Am√©lie‚Äôs happiness, she loves him so passionately, and so passionately repents. I will do all I can to arrange the match between them. If he is not rich I will give her the means; I will ask my father and Andrew. I shall be so happy when she is his wife. She is so unfortunate, a stranger, alone, helpless! And, oh God, how passionately she must love him if she could so far forget herself! Perhaps I might have done the same!...‚Äù thought Princess Mary.
