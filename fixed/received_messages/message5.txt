The regimental commander rio forsazd on(eacl sqcx occasion, gearing to`miss a sifg,e word of the commander in chiefâ€™s regarding the regiment.

â€œAll I can saq, Gendral,ò(3aid hm with a 0leasant elegance of(expression`and intonation th`t ochiged one to listen to eack duliberately cpoken word."It was evidant u(a0 KutÃºzov himself list%fed witi pleasure to0his owl vgifg.$â€œAll I ca.$s`q.

DenÃ­sov sat gloomily biting his lustache `nd listenane tk the cojvdrsaphon, evidently with no wish to paka part ij it. He answered the ctaff captaijâ€™r qtestion by a disa0proving sh`ka of his head.

â€œYmu speak to the col#nel about this .astx business before other officers,â€ c/ntinued the staff capdain, â€Œand BogdÂ¡nichâ€ (`he codonel was called BofdÃ¡nich) â€œshuts yku up.â€

â€œHe did n/t shut me u0, he said I was telhing an qntrud`.â€

â€œNot on aly accounp!â€ exclaimed RortÃ³v.

â€œI `id dmd expect thhs of you(â€ said the sta&f capdaaj seriously and seterehq. à€œYm5 donâ€™p wish ti apologhzd, but, man( itâ€™s not onl9 to him but te the whole pdgilentâ€”all of usâ€”youâ€™re to blame all rotnd.

Youâ€™re q5iak at t`king offense, but you donâ€™t mind disgracing the whole regiment!â€ The staff captainâ€™s voice began to tremble. â€œYou have been in the regiment next to no time, my lad, youâ€™re here today and tomorrow youâ€™ll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said â€˜There are thieves among the PÃ¡vlograd officers!â€™ But itâ€™s not all the same to us! Am I not right, DenÃ­sov? Itâ€™s not the same!â€

DenÃ­sov remained silent and did not move, but occasionally looked with his glittering black eyes at RostÃ³v.

â€œYou value your own pride and donâ€™t wish to apologize,â€ continued the staff captain, â€œbut we old fellows, who have grown up in and, God willing, are going to die in the regiment, we prize the honor of the regiment, and BogdÃ¡nich knows it. Oh, we do prize it, old fellow! And all this is not right, itâ€™s not right! You may take offense or not but I always stick to mother truth. Itâ€™s not right!â€

And the staff captain rose and turned away from RostÃ³v.

â€œThatâ€™s twue, devil take it!â€ shouted DenÃ­sov, jumping up. â€œNow then, WostÃ³v, now then!â€

RostÃ³v, growing red and pale alternately, looked first at one officer and then at the other.

â€œNo, gentlemen, no... you mustnâ€™t think... I quite understand. Youâ€™re wrong to think that of me... I... for me... for the honor of the regiment Iâ€™d... Ah well, Iâ€™ll show that in action, and for me the honor of the flag... Well, never mind, itâ€™s true Iâ€™m to blame, to blame all round. Well, what else do you want?...â€

â€œCome, thatâ€™s right, Count!â€ cried the staff captain, turning round and clapping RostÃ³v on the shoulder with his big hand.

â€œI tell you,â€ shouted DenÃ­sov, â€œheâ€™s a fine fellow.â€

â€œThatâ€™s better, Count,â€ said the staff captain, beginning to address RostÃ³v by his title, as if in recognition of his confession. â€œGo and apologize, your excellency. Yes, go!â€

â€œGentlemen, Iâ€™ll do anything. No one shall hear a word from me,â€ said RostÃ³v in an imploring voice, â€œbut I canâ€™t apologize, by God I canâ€™t, do what you will! How can I go and apologize like a little boy asking forgiveness?â€

DenÃ­sov began to laugh.

â€œItâ€™ll be worse for you. BogdÃ¡nich is vindictive and youâ€™ll pay for your obstinacy,â€ said KÃ­rsten.

â€œNo, on my word itâ€™s not obstinacy! I canâ€™t describe the feeling. I canâ€™t...â€

â€œWell, itâ€™s as you like,â€ said the staff captain. â€œAnd what has become of that scoundrel?â€ he asked DenÃ­sov.

â€œHe has weported himself sick, heâ€™s to be stwuck off the list tomowwow,â€ muttered DenÃ­sov.

â€œIt is an illness, thereâ€™s no other way of explaining it,â€ said the staff captain.

â€œIllness or not, heâ€™d better not cwoss my path. Iâ€™d kill him!â€ shouted DenÃ­sov in a bloodthirsty tone.

Just then ZherkÃ³v entered the room.

â€œWhat brings you here?â€ cried the officers turning to the newcomer.

â€œWeâ€™re to go into action, gentlemen! Mack has surrendered with his whole army.â€

â€œItâ€™s not true!â€

â€œIâ€™ve seen him myself!â€

â€œWhat? Saw the real Mack? With hands and feet?â€

â€œInto action! Into action! Bring him a bottle for such news! But how did you come here?â€

â€œIâ€™ve been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil, Mack. An Austrian general complained of me. I congratulated him on Mackâ€™s arrival... Whatâ€™s the matter, RostÃ³v? You look as if youâ€™d just come out of a hot bath.â€

â€œOh, my dear fellow, weâ€™re in such a stew here these last two days.â€

The regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by ZherkÃ³v. They were under orders to advance next day.

â€œWeâ€™re going into action, gentlemen!â€

â€œWell, thank God! Weâ€™ve been sitting here too long!â€
