‚ÄúOh yes,‚Äù assented Princess Mary, ‚Äúperhaps that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôll go. Courage, my angel.‚Äù She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room.

‚ÄúOh, no, no!‚Äù And besides the pallor and the physical suffering on the little princess‚Äô face, an expression of childish fear of inevitable pain showed itself.

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs only indigestion?... Say it‚Äôs only indigestion, say so, Mary! Say...‚Äù And the little princess began to cry capriciously like a suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some affectation. Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary Bogd√°novna.

‚ÄúMon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh!‚Äù she heard as she left the room.

The midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her small, plump white hands with an air of calm importance.

‚ÄúMary Bogd√°novna, I think it‚Äôs beginning!‚Äù said Princess Mary looking at the midwife with wide-open eyes of alarm.

‚ÄúG+d hs merciful, bhpdid.‚Äù
T(e nurse lip superstition that the fewer the people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers, everyone tried to pretend not to know; no one spoke of it, but apart from the ordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the prince‚Äôs household, a common anxiety, a softening of the heart, and a consciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplished at that moment made itself felt.

There was no laughter in the maids‚Äô large hall. In the men servants‚Äô hall all sat waiting, silently and alert. In the outlying serfs‚Äô quarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept. The old prince, stepping on his heels, paced up and down his study and sent T√≠khon to ask Mary Bogd√°novna what news.‚Äî‚ÄúSay only that ‚Äòthe prince told me to ask,‚Äô and come and tell me her answer.‚Äù

‚ÄúInform the prince that labor has begun,‚Äù said Mary Bogd√°novna, giving the messenger a significant look.

T√≠khon went and told the prince.

‚ÄúVery good!‚Äù said the prince closing the door behind him, and T√≠khon did not hear the slightest sound from the study after that.

After a while he re-entered it as if to snuff the candles, and, seeing the prince was lying on the sofa, looked at him, noticed his perturbed face, shook his head, and going up to him silently kissed him on the shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he had entered. The most solemn mystery in the world continued its course. Evening passed, night came, and the feeling of suspense and softening of heart in the presence of the unfathomable did not lessen but increased. No one slept.

It was one of those March nights when winter seems to wish to resume its sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury. A relay of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the German doctor from Moscow who was expected every moment, and men on horseback with lanterns were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with its hollows and snow-covered pools of water.

Princess Mary had long since put aside her book: she sat silent, her luminous eyes fixed on her nurse‚Äôs wrinkled face (every line of which she knew so well), on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the kerchief, and the loose skin that hung under her chin.

Nurse S√°vishna, knitting in hand, was telling in low tones, scarcely hearing or understanding her own words, what she had told hundreds of times before: how the late princess had given birth to Princess Mary in Kishen√´v with only a Moldavian peasant woman to help instead of a midwife.

‚ÄúGod is merciful, doctors are never needed,‚Äù she said.

Suddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the window, from which the double frame had been removed (by order of the prince, one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the larks returned), and, forcing open a loosely closed latch, set the damask curtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill, snowy draft. Princess Mary shuddered; her nurse, putting down the stocking she was knitting, went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the open casement. The cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose locks of gray hair.

‚ÄúPrincess, my dear, there‚Äôs someone driving up the avenue!‚Äù she said, holding the casement and not closing it. ‚ÄúWith lanterns. Most likely the doctor.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, my God! thank God!‚Äù said Princess Mary. ‚ÄúI must go and meet him, he does not know Russian.‚Äù

Princess Mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer. As she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window a carriage with lanterns, standing at the entrance. She went out on the stairs. On a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft. On the landing below, Philip, the footman, stood looking scared and holding another candle. Still lower, beyond the turn of the staircase, one could hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots, and a voice that seemed familiar to Princess Mary was saying something.

‚ÄúThank God!‚Äù said the voice. ‚ÄúAnd Father?‚Äù

‚ÄúGone to bed,‚Äù replied the voice of Demy√°n the house steward, who was downstairs.

Then the voice said something more, Demy√°n replied, and the steps in the felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Andrew!‚Äù thought Princess Mary. ‚ÄúNo it can‚Äôt be, that would be too extraordinary,‚Äù and at the very moment she thought this, the face and figure of Prince Andrew, in a fur cloak the deep collar of which covered with snow, appeared on the landing where the footman stood with the candle. Yes, it was he, pale, thin, with a changed and strangely softened but agitated expression on his face. He came up the stairs and embraced his sister.

‚ÄúYou did not get my letter?‚Äù he asked, and not waiting for a reply‚Äîwhich he would not have received, for the princess was unable to speak‚Äîhe turned back, rapidly mounted the stairs again with the doctor who had entered the hall after him (they had met at the last post station), and again embraced his sister.

‚ÄúWhat a strange fate, M√°sha darling!‚Äù And having taken off his cloak and felt boots, he went to the little princess‚Äô apartment.

CHAPTER IX
The little princess lay supported by pillows, with a white cap on her head (the pains had just left her). Strands of her black hair lay round her inflamed and perspiring cheeks, her charming rosy mouth with its downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully. Prince Andrew entered and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying. Her glittering eyes, filled with childlike fear and excitement, rested on him without changing their expression. ‚ÄúI love you all and have done no harm to anyone; why must I suffer so? Help me!‚Äù her look seemed to say. She saw her husband, but did not realize the significance of his appearance before her now. Prince Andrew went round the sofa and kissed her forehead.

‚ÄúMy darling!‚Äù he said‚Äîa word he had never used to her before. ‚ÄúGod is merciful....‚Äù

She looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach.

‚ÄúI expected help from 1-! `fdha d ha‚ % &a,ebb`lc! `0)a  `d h` @u0  ")en $h `2 4`l! h` yi4 e %(r(p "ea`0 f`" al9t `nf ` d &q,2b e &¡≠am$ b h`  `d@dBb` B(ah/(  BwAq.A di,td!"h `a2 F  ,"% Ha A  p4`` `hab`!r`` t`a @	d ,d  hd!  d@ a!r( S  t  `c	fu@ 8 (p0HAbout your sister,‚Äù ejaculated Den√≠sov testily.

Rost√≥v smiled.

‚ÄúMy dear count, you were one of my best pupils‚Äîyou must dance,‚Äù said little Iogel coming up to Nicholas. ‚ÄúLook how many charming young ladies‚Äî‚Äù He turned with the same request to Den√≠sov who was also a former pupil of his.

‚ÄúNo, my dear fellow, I‚Äôll be a wallflower,‚Äù said Den√≠sov. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you wecollect what bad use I made of your lessons?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no!‚Äù said Iogel, hastening to reassure him. ‚ÄúYou were only inattentive, but you had talent‚Äîoh yes, you had talent!‚Äù

The band struck up the newly introduced mazurka. Nicholas could not refuse Iogel and asked S√≥nya to dance. Den√≠sov sat down by the old ladies and, leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot, told them something funny and kept them amused, while he watched the young people dancing, Iogel with Nat√°sha, his pride and his best pupil, were the first couple. Noiselessly, skillfully stepping with his little feet in low shoes, Iogel flew first across the hall with Nat√°sha, who, though shy, went on carefully executing her steps. Den√≠sov did not take his eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not because he could not. In the middle of a figure he beckoned to Rost√≥v who was passing:

‚ÄúThis is not at all the thing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat sort of Polish mazuwka is this? But she does dance splendidly.‚Äù

Knowing that Den√≠sov had a reputation even in Poland for the masterly way in which he danced the mazurka, Nicholas ran up to Nat√°sha:

‚ÄúGo and choose Den√≠sov. He is a real dancer, a wonder!‚Äù he said.

When it came to Nat√°sha‚Äôs turn to choose a partner, she rose and, tripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows, ran timidly to the corner where Den√≠sov sat. She saw that everybody was looking at her and waiting. Nicholas saw that Den√≠sov was refusing though he smiled delightedly. He ran up to them.

‚ÄúPlease, Vas√≠li Dm√≠trich,‚Äù Nat√°sha was saying, ‚Äúdo come!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no, let me off, Countess,‚Äù Den√≠sov replied.

‚ÄúNow then, V√°ska,‚Äù said Nicholas.

‚ÄúThey coax me as if I were V√°ska the cat!‚Äù said Den√≠sov jokingly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll sing for you a whole evening,‚Äù said Nat√°sha.

‚ÄúOh, the faiwy! She can do anything with me!‚Äù said Den√≠sov, and he unhooked his saber. He came out from behind the chairs, clasped his partner‚Äôs hand firmly, threw back his head, and advanced his foot, waiting for the beat. Only on horse back and in the mazurka was Den√≠sov‚Äôs short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow he felt himself to be. At the right beat of the music he looked sideways at his partner with a merry and triumphant air, suddenly stamped with one foot, bounded from the floor like a ball, and flew round the room taking his partner with him. He glided silently on one foot half across the room, and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at them, when suddenly, clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs, he stopped short on his heels, stood so a second, stamped on the spot clanking his spurs, whirled rapidly round, and, striking his left heel against his right, flew round again in a circle. Nat√°sha guessed what he meant to do, and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly knowing how. First he spun her round, holding her now with his left, now with his right hand, then falling on one knee he twirled her round him, and again jumping up, dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if he would rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath, and then he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps. When at last, smartly whirling his partner round in front of her chair, he drew up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her, Nat√°sha did not even make him a curtsy. She fixed her eyes on him in amazement, smiling as if she did not recognize him.

‚ÄúWhat does this mean?‚Äù she brought out.

Although Iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka, everyone was delighted with Den√≠sov‚Äôs skill, he was asked again and again as a partner, and the old men began smilingly to talk about Poland and the good old days. Den√≠sov, flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself with his handkerchief, sat down by Nat√°sha and did not leave her for the rest of the evening.

CHAPTER XIII
For two days after that Rost√≥v did not see D√≥lokhov at his own or at D√≥lokhov‚Äôs home: on the third day he received a note from him:

As I do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know of, and am going to rejoin my regiment, I am giving a farewell supper tonight to my friends‚Äîcome to the English Hotel.

About ten o‚Äôclock Rost√≥v went to the English Hotel straight from the theater, where he had been with his family and Den√≠sov. He was at once shown to the best room, which D√≥lokhov had taken for that evening. Some twenty men were gathered round a table at which D√≥lokhov sat between two candles. On the table was a pile of gold and paper money, and he was keeping the bank. Rost√≥v had not seen him since his proposal and S√≥nya‚Äôs refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they would meet.

D√≥lokhov‚Äôs clear, cold glance met Rost√≥v as soon as he entered the door, as though he had long expected him.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long time since we met,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThanks for coming. I‚Äôll just finish dealing, and then Ily√∫shka will come with his chorus.‚Äù

‚ÄúI called once or twice at your house,‚Äù said Rost√≥v, reddening.

D√≥lokhov made no reply.

‚ÄúYou may punt,‚Äù he said.

Rost√≥v recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had with D√≥lokhov. ‚ÄúNone but fools trust to luck in play,‚Äù D√≥lokhov had then said.

‚ÄúOr are you afraid to play with me?‚Äù D√≥lokhov now asked as if guessing Rost√≥v‚Äôs thought.

Beneath his smile Rost√≥v saw in him the mood he had shown at the club dinner and at other times, when as if tired of everyday life he had felt a need to escape from it by some strange, and usually cruel, action.

Rost√≥v felt ill at ease. He tried, but failed, to find some joke with which to reply to D√≥lokhov‚Äôs words. But before he had thought of anything, D√≥lokhov, looking straight in his face, said slowly and deliberately so that everyone could hear:

‚ÄúDo you remember we had a talk about cards... ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs a fool who trusts to luck, one should make certain,‚Äô and I want to try.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo try his luck or the certainty?‚Äù Rost√≥v asked himself.

‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôd better not play,‚Äù D√≥lokhov added, and springing a new pack of cards said: ‚ÄúBank, gentlemen!‚Äù

Moving the money forward he prepared to deal. Rost√≥v sat down by his side and at first did not play. D√≥lokhov kept glancing at him.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you play?‚Äù he asked.

And strange to say Nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a card, putting a small stake on it, and beginning to play.

‚ÄúI have no money with me,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll trust you.‚Äù

Rost√≥v staked five rubles on a card and lost, staked again, and again lost. D√≥lokhov ‚Äúkilled,‚Äù that is, beat, ten cards of Rost√≥v‚Äôs running.

‚ÄúGentlemen,‚Äù said D√≥lokhov after he had dealt for some time. ‚ÄúPlease place your money on the cards or I may get muddled in the reckoning.‚Äù

One of the players said he hoped he might be trusted.

‚ÄúYes, you might, but I am afraid of getting the accounts mixed. So I ask you to put the money on your cards,‚Äù replied D√≥lokhov. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stint yourself, we‚Äôll settle afterwards,‚Äù he added, turning to Rost√≥v.

The game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne.

All Rost√≥v‚Äôs cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored up against him. He wrote ‚Äú800 rubles‚Äù on a card, but while the waiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual stake of twenty rubles.

‚ÄúLeave it,‚Äù said D√≥lokhov, though he did not seem to be even looking at Rost√≥v, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll win it back all the sooner. I lose to the others but win from you. Or are you afraid of me?‚Äù he asked again.

Rost√≥v submitted. He let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven of hearts with a torn corner, which he had picked up from the floor. He well remembered that seven afterwards. He laid down the seven of hearts, on which with a broken bit of chalk he had written ‚Äú800 rubles‚Äù in clear upright figures; he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was handed him, smiled at D√≥lokhov‚Äôs words, and with a sinking heart, waiting for a seven to turn up, gazed at D√≥lokhov‚Äôs hands which held the pack. Much depended on Rost√≥v‚Äôs winning or losing on that seven of hearts. On the previous Sunday the old count had given his son two thousand rubles, and though he always disliked speaking of money difficulties had told Nicholas that this was all he could let him have till May, and asked him to be more economical this time. Nicholas had replied that it would be more than enough for him and that he gave his word of honor not to take anything more till the spring. Now only twelve hundred rubles was left of that money, so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the loss of sixteen hundred rubles, but the necessity of going back on his word. With a sinking heart he watched D√≥lokhov‚Äôs hands and thought, ‚ÄúNow then, make haste and let me have this card and I‚Äôll take my cap and drive home to supper with Den√≠sov, Nat√°sha, and S√≥nya, and will certainly never touch a card again.‚Äù At that moment his home life, jokes with P√©tya, talks with S√≥nya, duets with Nat√°sha, piquet with his father, and even his comfortable bed in the house on the Povarsk√°ya rose before him with such vividness, clearness, and charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss, long past. He could not conceive that a stupid chance, letting the seven be dealt to the right rather than to the left, might deprive him of all this happiness, newly appreciated and newly illumined, and plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined misery. That could not be, yet he awaited with a sinking heart the movement of D√≥lokhov‚Äôs hands. Those broad, reddish hands, with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs, laid down the pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were handed him.

‚ÄúSo you are not afraid to play with me?‚Äù repeated D√≥lokhov, and as if about to tell a good story he put down the cards, leaned back in his chair, and began deliberately with a smile:

‚ÄúYes, gentlemen, I‚Äôve been told there‚Äôs a rumor going about Moscow that I‚Äôm a sharper, so I advise you to be careful.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome now, deal!‚Äù exclaimed Rost√≥v.

‚ÄúOh, those Moscow gossips!‚Äù said D√≥lokhov, and he took up the cards with a smile.

‚ÄúAah!‚Äù Rost√≥v almost screamed lifting both hands to his head. The seven he needed was lying uppermost, the first card in the pack. He had lost more than he could pay.

‚ÄúStill, don‚Äôt ruin yourself!‚Äù said D√≥lokhov with a side glance at Rost√≥v as he continued to deal.

CHAPTER XIV
An hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested in their own play.

The whole interest was concentrated on Rost√≥v. Instead of sixteen hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him, which he had reckoned up to ten thousand, but that now, as he vaguely supposed, must have risen to fifteen thousand. In reality it already exceeded twenty thousand rubles. D√≥lokhov was no longer listening to stories or telling them, but followed every movement of Rost√≥v‚Äôs hands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him. He had decided to play until that score reached forty-three thousand. He had fixed on that number because forty-three was the sum of his and S√≥nya‚Äôs joint ages. Rost√≥v, leaning his head on both hands, sat at the table which was scrawled over with figures, wet with spilled wine, and littered with cards. One tormenting impression did not leave him: that those broad-boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt sleeves, those hands which he loved and hated, held him in their power.

‚ÄúSix hundred rubles, ace, a corner, a nine... winning it back‚Äôs impossible... Oh, how pleasant it was at home!... The knave, double or quits... it can‚Äôt be!... And why is he doing this to me?‚Äù Rost√≥v pondered. Sometimes he staked a large sum, but D√≥lokhov refused to accept it and fixed the stake himself. Nicholas submitted to him, and at one moment prayed to God as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge over the Enns, and then guessed that the card that came first to hand from the crumpled heap under the table would save him, now counted the cords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the total of his losses on it, then he looked round for aid from the other players, or peered at the now cold face of D√≥lokhov and tried to read what was passing in his mind.

‚ÄúHe knows of course what this loss means to me. He can‚Äôt want my ruin. Wasn‚Äôt he my friend? Wasn‚Äôt I fond of him? But it‚Äôs not his fault. What‚Äôs he to do if he has such luck?... And it‚Äôs not my fault either,‚Äù he thought to himself, ‚ÄúI have done nothing wrong. Have I killed anyone, or insulted or wished harm to anyone? Why such a terrible misfortune? And when did it begin? Such a little while ago I came to this table with the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that casket for Mamma‚Äôs name day and then going home. I was so happy, so free, so lighthearted! And I did not realize how happy I was! When did that end and when did this new, terrible state of things begin? What marked the change? I sat all the time in this same place at this table, chose and placed cards, and watched those broad-boned agile hands in the same way. When did it happen and what has happened? I am well and strong and still the same and in the same place. No, it can‚Äôt be! Surely it will all end in nothing!‚Äù

He was flushed and bathed in perspiration, though the room was not hot. His face was terrible and piteous to see, especially from its helpless efforts to seem calm.

The score against him reached the fateful sum of forty-three thousand. Rost√≥v had just prepared a card, by bending the corner of which he meant to double the three thousand just put down to his score, when D√≥lokhov, slamming down the pack of cards, put it aside and began rapidly adding up the total of Rost√≥v‚Äôs debt, breaking the chalk as he marked the figures in his clear, bold hand.

‚ÄúSupper, it‚Äôs time for supper! And here are the gypsies!‚Äù

Some swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outside and saying something in their gypsy accents. Nicholas understood that it was all over; but he said in an indifferent tone:

‚ÄúWell, won‚Äôt you go on? I had a splendid card all ready,‚Äù as if it were the fun of the game which interested him most.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all up! I‚Äôm lost!‚Äù thought he. ‚ÄúNow a bullet through my brain‚Äîthat‚Äôs all that‚Äôs left me!‚Äù And at the same time he said in a cheerful voice:

‚ÄúCome now, just this one more little card!‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right!‚Äù said D√≥lokhov, having finished the addition. ‚ÄúAll right! Twenty-one rubles,‚Äù he said, pointing to the figure twenty-one by which the total exceeded the round sum of forty-three thousand; and taking up a pack he prepared to deal. Rost√≥v submissively unbent the corner of his card and, instead of the six thousand he had intended, carefully wrote twenty-one.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all the same to me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI only want to see whether you will let me win this ten, or beat it.‚Äù

D√≥lokhov began to deal seriously. Oh, how Rost√≥v detested at that moment those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists, which held him in their power.... The ten fell to him.

‚ÄúYou owe forty-three thousand, Count,‚Äù said D√≥lokhov, and stretching himself he rose from the table. ‚ÄúOne does get tired sitting so long,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm tired too,‚Äù said Rost√≥v.

D√≥lokhov cut him short, as if to remind him that it was not for him to jest.

‚ÄúWhen am I to receive the money, Count?‚Äù

Rost√≥v, flushing, drew D√≥lokhov into the next room.

‚ÄúI cannot pay it all immediately. Will you take an I.O.U.?‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI say, Rost√≥v,‚Äù said D√≥lokhov clearly, smiling and looking Nicholas straight in the eyes, ‚Äúyou know the saying, ‚ÄòLucky in love, unlucky at cards.‚Äô Your cousin is in love with you, I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs terrible to feel oneself so in this man‚Äôs power,‚Äù thought Rost√≥v. He knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and mother by the news of this loss, he knew what a relief it would be to escape it all, and felt that D√≥lokhov knew that he could save him from all this shame and sorrow, but wanted now to play with him as a cat does with a mouse.

‚ÄúYour cousin...‚Äù D√≥lokhov started to say, but Nicholas interrupted him.

‚ÄúMy cousin has nothing to do with this and it‚Äôs not necessary to mention her!‚Äù he exclaimed fiercely.

‚ÄúThen when am I to have it?‚Äù

‚ÄúTomorrow,‚Äù replied Rost√≥v and left the room.
