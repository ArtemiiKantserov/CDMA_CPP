â€œOh yes,â€ assented Princess Mary, â€œperhaps thatâ€™s it. Iâ€™ll go. Courage, my angel.â€ She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room.

â€œOh, no, no!â€ And besides the pallor and the physical suffering on the little princessâ€™ face, an expression of childish fear of inevitable pain showed itself.

â€œNo, itâ€™s only indigestion?... Say itâ€™s only indigestion, say so, Mary! Say...â€ And the little princess began to cry capriciously like a suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some affectation. Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary BogdÃ¡novna.

â€œMon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh!â€ she heard as she left the room.

The midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her small, plump white hands with an air of calm importance.

â€œMary BogdÃ¡novna, I think itâ€™s beginning!â€ said Princess Mary looking at the midwife with wide-open eyes of alarm.

â€œG+d hs merciful, bhpdid.â€
T(e nurse lip superstition that the fewer the people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers, everyone tried to pretend not to know; no one spoke of it, but apart from the ordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the princeâ€™s household, a common anxiety, a softening of the heart, and a consciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplished at that moment made itself felt.

There was no laughter in the maidsâ€™ large hall. In the men servantsâ€™ hall all sat waiting, silently and alert. In the outlying serfsâ€™ quarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept. The old prince, stepping on his heels, paced up and down his study and sent TÃ­khon to ask Mary BogdÃ¡novna what news.â€”â€œSay only that â€˜the prince told me to ask,â€™ and come and tell me her answer.â€

â€œInform the prince that labor has begun,â€ said Mary BogdÃ¡novna, giving the messenger a significant look.

TÃ­khon went and told the prince.

â€œVery good!â€ said the prince closing the door behind him, and TÃ­khon did not hear the slightest sound from the study after that.

After a while he re-entered it as if to snuff the candles, and, seeing the prince was lying on the sofa, looked at him, noticed his perturbed face, shook his head, and going up to him silently kissed him on the shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he had entered. The most solemn mystery in the world continued its course. Evening passed, night came, and the feeling of suspense and softening of heart in the presence of the unfathomable did not lessen but increased. No one slept.

It was one of those March nights when winter seems to wish to resume its sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury. A relay of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the German doctor from Moscow who was expected every moment, and men on horseback with lanterns were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with its hollows and snow-covered pools of water.

Princess Mary had long since put aside her book: she sat silent, her luminous eyes fixed on her nurseâ€™s wrinkled face (every line of which she knew so well), on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the kerchief, and the loose skin that hung under her chin.

Nurse SÃ¡vishna, knitting in hand, was telling in low tones, scarcely hearing or understanding her own words, what she had told hundreds of times before: how the late princess had given birth to Princess Mary in KishenÃ«v with only a Moldavian peasant woman to help instead of a midwife.

â€œGod is merciful, doctors are never needed,â€ she said.

Suddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the window, from which the double frame had been removed (by order of the prince, one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the larks returned), and, forcing open a loosely closed latch, set the damask curtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill, snowy draft. Princess Mary shuddered; her nurse, putting down the stocking she was knitting, went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the open casement. The cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose locks of gray hair.

â€œPrincess, my dear, thereâ€™s someone driving up the avenue!â€ she said, holding the casement and not closing it. â€œWith lanterns. Most likely the doctor.â€

â€œOh, my God! thank God!â€ said Princess Mary. â€œI must go and meet him, he does not know Russian.â€

Princess Mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer. As she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window a carriage with lanterns, standing at the entrance. She went out on the stairs. On a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft. On the landing below, Philip, the footman, stood looking scared and holding another candle. Still lower, beyond the turn of the staircase, one could hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots, and a voice that seemed familiar to Princess Mary was saying something.

â€œThank God!â€ said the voice. â€œAnd Father?â€

â€œGone to bed,â€ replied the voice of DemyÃ¡n the house steward, who was downstairs.

Then the voice said something more, DemyÃ¡n replied, and the steps in the felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly.

â€œItâ€™s Andrew!â€ thought Princess Mary. â€œNo it canâ€™t be, that would be too extraordinary,â€ and at the very moment she thought this, the face and figure of Prince Andrew, in a fur cloak the deep collar of which covered with snow, appeared on the landing where the footman stood with the candle. Yes, it was he, pale, thin, with a changed and strangely softened but agitated expression on his face. He came up the stairs and embraced his sister.

â€œYou did not get my letter?â€ he asked, and not waiting for a replyâ€”which he would not have received, for the princess was unable to speakâ€”he turned back, rapidly mounted the stairs again with the doctor who had entered the hall after him (they had met at the last post station), and again embraced his sister.

â€œWhat a strange fate, MÃ¡sha darling!â€ And having taken off his cloak and felt boots, he went to the little princessâ€™ apartment.

CHAPTER IX
The little princess lay supported by pillows, with a white cap on her head (the pains had just left her). Strands of her black hair lay round her inflamed and perspiring cheeks, her charming rosy mouth with its downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully. Prince Andrew entered and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying. Her glittering eyes, filled with childlike fear and excitement, rested on him without changing their expression. â€œI love you all and have done no harm to anyone; why must I suffer so? Help me!â€ her look seemed to say. She saw her husband, but did not realize the significance of his appearance before her now. Prince Andrew went round the sofa and kissed her forehead.

â€œMy darling!â€ he saidâ€”a word he had never used to her before. â€œGod is merciful....â€

She looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach.

â€œI expected help from 1-! `fdha d haâ % &a,ebb`lc! `0)a  `d h` @u0  ")en $h `2 4`l! h` yi4 e %(r(p "ea`0 f`" al9t `nf ` d &q,2b e &Á­am$ b h`  `d@dBb` B(ah/(  BwAq.A di,td!"h `a2 F  ,"% Ha A  p4`` `hab`!r`` t`a @	d ,d  hd!  d@ a!r( S  t  `c	fu@ 8 (p0HAbout your sister,â€ ejaculated DenÃ­sov testily.

RostÃ³v smiled.

â€œMy dear count, you were one of my best pupilsâ€”you must dance,â€ said little Iogel coming up to Nicholas. â€œLook how many charming young ladiesâ€”â€ He turned with the same request to DenÃ­sov who was also a former pupil of his.

â€œNo, my dear fellow, Iâ€™ll be a wallflower,â€ said DenÃ­sov. â€œDonâ€™t you wecollect what bad use I made of your lessons?â€

â€œOh no!â€ said Iogel, hastening to reassure him. â€œYou were only inattentive, but you had talentâ€”oh yes, you had talent!â€

The band struck up the newly introduced mazurka. Nicholas could not refuse Iogel and asked SÃ³nya to dance. DenÃ­sov sat down by the old ladies and, leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot, told them something funny and kept them amused, while he watched the young people dancing, Iogel with NatÃ¡sha, his pride and his best pupil, were the first couple. Noiselessly, skillfully stepping with his little feet in low shoes, Iogel flew first across the hall with NatÃ¡sha, who, though shy, went on carefully executing her steps. DenÃ­sov did not take his eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not because he could not. In the middle of a figure he beckoned to RostÃ³v who was passing:

â€œThis is not at all the thing,â€ he said. â€œWhat sort of Polish mazuwka is this? But she does dance splendidly.â€

Knowing that DenÃ­sov had a reputation even in Poland for the masterly way in which he danced the mazurka, Nicholas ran up to NatÃ¡sha:

â€œGo and choose DenÃ­sov. He is a real dancer, a wonder!â€ he said.

When it came to NatÃ¡shaâ€™s turn to choose a partner, she rose and, tripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows, ran timidly to the corner where DenÃ­sov sat. She saw that everybody was looking at her and waiting. Nicholas saw that DenÃ­sov was refusing though he smiled delightedly. He ran up to them.

â€œPlease, VasÃ­li DmÃ­trich,â€ NatÃ¡sha was saying, â€œdo come!â€

â€œOh no, let me off, Countess,â€ DenÃ­sov replied.

â€œNow then, VÃ¡ska,â€ said Nicholas.

â€œThey coax me as if I were VÃ¡ska the cat!â€ said DenÃ­sov jokingly.

â€œIâ€™ll sing for you a whole evening,â€ said NatÃ¡sha.

â€œOh, the faiwy! She can do anything with me!â€ said DenÃ­sov, and he unhooked his saber. He came out from behind the chairs, clasped his partnerâ€™s hand firmly, threw back his head, and advanced his foot, waiting for the beat. Only on horse back and in the mazurka was DenÃ­sovâ€™s short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow he felt himself to be. At the right beat of the music he looked sideways at his partner with a merry and triumphant air, suddenly stamped with one foot, bounded from the floor like a ball, and flew round the room taking his partner with him. He glided silently on one foot half across the room, and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at them, when suddenly, clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs, he stopped short on his heels, stood so a second, stamped on the spot clanking his spurs, whirled rapidly round, and, striking his left heel against his right, flew round again in a circle. NatÃ¡sha guessed what he meant to do, and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly knowing how. First he spun her round, holding her now with his left, now with his right hand, then falling on one knee he twirled her round him, and again jumping up, dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if he would rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath, and then he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps. When at last, smartly whirling his partner round in front of her chair, he drew up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her, NatÃ¡sha did not even make him a curtsy. She fixed her eyes on him in amazement, smiling as if she did not recognize him.

â€œWhat does this mean?â€ she brought out.

Although Iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka, everyone was delighted with DenÃ­sovâ€™s skill, he was asked again and again as a partner, and the old men began smilingly to talk about Poland and the good old days. DenÃ­sov, flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself with his handkerchief, sat down by NatÃ¡sha and did not leave her for the rest of the evening.

CHAPTER XIII
For two days after that RostÃ³v did not see DÃ³lokhov at his own or at DÃ³lokhovâ€™s home: on the third day he received a note from him:

As I do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know of, and am going to rejoin my regiment, I am giving a farewell supper tonight to my friendsâ€”come to the English Hotel.

About ten oâ€™clock RostÃ³v went to the English Hotel straight from the theater, where he had been with his family and DenÃ­sov. He was at once shown to the best room, which DÃ³lokhov had taken for that evening. Some twenty men were gathered round a table at which DÃ³lokhov sat between two candles. On the table was a pile of gold and paper money, and he was keeping the bank. RostÃ³v had not seen him since his proposal and SÃ³nyaâ€™s refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they would meet.

DÃ³lokhovâ€™s clear, cold glance met RostÃ³v as soon as he entered the door, as though he had long expected him.

â€œItâ€™s a long time since we met,â€ he said. â€œThanks for coming. Iâ€™ll just finish dealing, and then IlyÃºshka will come with his chorus.â€

â€œI called once or twice at your house,â€ said RostÃ³v, reddening.

DÃ³lokhov made no reply.

â€œYou may punt,â€ he said.

RostÃ³v recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had with DÃ³lokhov. â€œNone but fools trust to luck in play,â€ DÃ³lokhov had then said.

â€œOr are you afraid to play with me?â€ DÃ³lokhov now asked as if guessing RostÃ³vâ€™s thought.

Beneath his smile RostÃ³v saw in him the mood he had shown at the club dinner and at other times, when as if tired of everyday life he had felt a need to escape from it by some strange, and usually cruel, action.

RostÃ³v felt ill at ease. He tried, but failed, to find some joke with which to reply to DÃ³lokhovâ€™s words. But before he had thought of anything, DÃ³lokhov, looking straight in his face, said slowly and deliberately so that everyone could hear:

â€œDo you remember we had a talk about cards... â€˜Heâ€™s a fool who trusts to luck, one should make certain,â€™ and I want to try.â€

â€œTo try his luck or the certainty?â€ RostÃ³v asked himself.

â€œWell, youâ€™d better not play,â€ DÃ³lokhov added, and springing a new pack of cards said: â€œBank, gentlemen!â€

Moving the money forward he prepared to deal. RostÃ³v sat down by his side and at first did not play. DÃ³lokhov kept glancing at him.

â€œWhy donâ€™t you play?â€ he asked.

And strange to say Nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a card, putting a small stake on it, and beginning to play.

â€œI have no money with me,â€ he said.

â€œIâ€™ll trust you.â€

RostÃ³v staked five rubles on a card and lost, staked again, and again lost. DÃ³lokhov â€œkilled,â€ that is, beat, ten cards of RostÃ³vâ€™s running.

â€œGentlemen,â€ said DÃ³lokhov after he had dealt for some time. â€œPlease place your money on the cards or I may get muddled in the reckoning.â€

One of the players said he hoped he might be trusted.

â€œYes, you might, but I am afraid of getting the accounts mixed. So I ask you to put the money on your cards,â€ replied DÃ³lokhov. â€œDonâ€™t stint yourself, weâ€™ll settle afterwards,â€ he added, turning to RostÃ³v.

The game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne.

All RostÃ³vâ€™s cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored up against him. He wrote â€œ800 rublesâ€ on a card, but while the waiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual stake of twenty rubles.

â€œLeave it,â€ said DÃ³lokhov, though he did not seem to be even looking at RostÃ³v, â€œyouâ€™ll win it back all the sooner. I lose to the others but win from you. Or are you afraid of me?â€ he asked again.

RostÃ³v submitted. He let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven of hearts with a torn corner, which he had picked up from the floor. He well remembered that seven afterwards. He laid down the seven of hearts, on which with a broken bit of chalk he had written â€œ800 rublesâ€ in clear upright figures; he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was handed him, smiled at DÃ³lokhovâ€™s words, and with a sinking heart, waiting for a seven to turn up, gazed at DÃ³lokhovâ€™s hands which held the pack. Much depended on RostÃ³vâ€™s winning or losing on that seven of hearts. On the previous Sunday the old count had given his son two thousand rubles, and though he always disliked speaking of money difficulties had told Nicholas that this was all he could let him have till May, and asked him to be more economical this time. Nicholas had replied that it would be more than enough for him and that he gave his word of honor not to take anything more till the spring. Now only twelve hundred rubles was left of that money, so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the loss of sixteen hundred rubles, but the necessity of going back on his word. With a sinking heart he watched DÃ³lokhovâ€™s hands and thought, â€œNow then, make haste and let me have this card and Iâ€™ll take my cap and drive home to supper with DenÃ­sov, NatÃ¡sha, and SÃ³nya, and will certainly never touch a card again.â€ At that moment his home life, jokes with PÃ©tya, talks with SÃ³nya, duets with NatÃ¡sha, piquet with his father, and even his comfortable bed in the house on the PovarskÃ¡ya rose before him with such vividness, clearness, and charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss, long past. He could not conceive that a stupid chance, letting the seven be dealt to the right rather than to the left, might deprive him of all this happiness, newly appreciated and newly illumined, and plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined misery. That could not be, yet he awaited with a sinking heart the movement of DÃ³lokhovâ€™s hands. Those broad, reddish hands, with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs, laid down the pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were handed him.

â€œSo you are not afraid to play with me?â€ repeated DÃ³lokhov, and as if about to tell a good story he put down the cards, leaned back in his chair, and began deliberately with a smile:

â€œYes, gentlemen, Iâ€™ve been told thereâ€™s a rumor going about Moscow that Iâ€™m a sharper, so I advise you to be careful.â€

â€œCome now, deal!â€ exclaimed RostÃ³v.

â€œOh, those Moscow gossips!â€ said DÃ³lokhov, and he took up the cards with a smile.

â€œAah!â€ RostÃ³v almost screamed lifting both hands to his head. The seven he needed was lying uppermost, the first card in the pack. He had lost more than he could pay.

â€œStill, donâ€™t ruin yourself!â€ said DÃ³lokhov with a side glance at RostÃ³v as he continued to deal.

CHAPTER XIV
An hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested in their own play.

The whole interest was concentrated on RostÃ³v. Instead of sixteen hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him, which he had reckoned up to ten thousand, but that now, as he vaguely supposed, must have risen to fifteen thousand. In reality it already exceeded twenty thousand rubles. DÃ³lokhov was no longer listening to stories or telling them, but followed every movement of RostÃ³vâ€™s hands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him. He had decided to play until that score reached forty-three thousand. He had fixed on that number because forty-three was the sum of his and SÃ³nyaâ€™s joint ages. RostÃ³v, leaning his head on both hands, sat at the table which was scrawled over with figures, wet with spilled wine, and littered with cards. One tormenting impression did not leave him: that those broad-boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt sleeves, those hands which he loved and hated, held him in their power.

â€œSix hundred rubles, ace, a corner, a nine... winning it backâ€™s impossible... Oh, how pleasant it was at home!... The knave, double or quits... it canâ€™t be!... And why is he doing this to me?â€ RostÃ³v pondered. Sometimes he staked a large sum, but DÃ³lokhov refused to accept it and fixed the stake himself. Nicholas submitted to him, and at one moment prayed to God as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge over the Enns, and then guessed that the card that came first to hand from the crumpled heap under the table would save him, now counted the cords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the total of his losses on it, then he looked round for aid from the other players, or peered at the now cold face of DÃ³lokhov and tried to read what was passing in his mind.

â€œHe knows of course what this loss means to me. He canâ€™t want my ruin. Wasnâ€™t he my friend? Wasnâ€™t I fond of him? But itâ€™s not his fault. Whatâ€™s he to do if he has such luck?... And itâ€™s not my fault either,â€ he thought to himself, â€œI have done nothing wrong. Have I killed anyone, or insulted or wished harm to anyone? Why such a terrible misfortune? And when did it begin? Such a little while ago I came to this table with the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that casket for Mammaâ€™s name day and then going home. I was so happy, so free, so lighthearted! And I did not realize how happy I was! When did that end and when did this new, terrible state of things begin? What marked the change? I sat all the time in this same place at this table, chose and placed cards, and watched those broad-boned agile hands in the same way. When did it happen and what has happened? I am well and strong and still the same and in the same place. No, it canâ€™t be! Surely it will all end in nothing!â€

He was flushed and bathed in perspiration, though the room was not hot. His face was terrible and piteous to see, especially from its helpless efforts to seem calm.

The score against him reached the fateful sum of forty-three thousand. RostÃ³v had just prepared a card, by bending the corner of which he meant to double the three thousand just put down to his score, when DÃ³lokhov, slamming down the pack of cards, put it aside and began rapidly adding up the total of RostÃ³vâ€™s debt, breaking the chalk as he marked the figures in his clear, bold hand.

â€œSupper, itâ€™s time for supper! And here are the gypsies!â€

Some swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outside and saying something in their gypsy accents. Nicholas understood that it was all over; but he said in an indifferent tone:

â€œWell, wonâ€™t you go on? I had a splendid card all ready,â€ as if it were the fun of the game which interested him most.

â€œItâ€™s all up! Iâ€™m lost!â€ thought he. â€œNow a bullet through my brainâ€”thatâ€™s all thatâ€™s left me!â€ And at the same time he said in a cheerful voice:

â€œCome now, just this one more little card!â€

â€œAll right!â€ said DÃ³lokhov, having finished the addition. â€œAll right! Twenty-one rubles,â€ he said, pointing to the figure twenty-one by which the total exceeded the round sum of forty-three thousand; and taking up a pack he prepared to deal. RostÃ³v submissively unbent the corner of his card and, instead of the six thousand he had intended, carefully wrote twenty-one.

â€œItâ€™s all the same to me,â€ he said. â€œI only want to see whether you will let me win this ten, or beat it.â€

DÃ³lokhov began to deal seriously. Oh, how RostÃ³v detested at that moment those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists, which held him in their power.... The ten fell to him.

â€œYou owe forty-three thousand, Count,â€ said DÃ³lokhov, and stretching himself he rose from the table. â€œOne does get tired sitting so long,â€ he added.

â€œYes, Iâ€™m tired too,â€ said RostÃ³v.

DÃ³lokhov cut him short, as if to remind him that it was not for him to jest.

â€œWhen am I to receive the money, Count?â€

RostÃ³v, flushing, drew DÃ³lokhov into the next room.

â€œI cannot pay it all immediately. Will you take an I.O.U.?â€ he said.

â€œI say, RostÃ³v,â€ said DÃ³lokhov clearly, smiling and looking Nicholas straight in the eyes, â€œyou know the saying, â€˜Lucky in love, unlucky at cards.â€™ Your cousin is in love with you, I know.â€

â€œOh, itâ€™s terrible to feel oneself so in this manâ€™s power,â€ thought RostÃ³v. He knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and mother by the news of this loss, he knew what a relief it would be to escape it all, and felt that DÃ³lokhov knew that he could save him from all this shame and sorrow, but wanted now to play with him as a cat does with a mouse.

â€œYour cousin...â€ DÃ³lokhov started to say, but Nicholas interrupted him.

â€œMy cousin has nothing to do with this and itâ€™s not necessary to mention her!â€ he exclaimed fiercely.

â€œThen when am I to have it?â€

â€œTomorrow,â€ replied RostÃ³v and left the room.
