BOOK ONE: 1805
CHAPTER I
â€œWell, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you donâ€™t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichristâ€”I really believe he is Antichristâ€”I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my â€˜faithful slave,â€™ as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened youâ€”sit down and tell me all the news.â€

It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna PÃ¡vlovna SchÃ©rer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress MÃ¡rya FÃ«dorovna. With these words she greeted Prince VasÃ­li KurÃ¡gin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna PÃ¡vlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.

All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:

â€œIf you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10â€”Annette SchÃ©rer.â€

â€œHeavens! what a virulent attack!â€ replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna PÃ¡vlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.

â€œFirst of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friendâ€™s mind at rest,â€ said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.

â€œCan one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?â€ said Anna PÃ¡vlovna. â€œYou are staying the whole evening, I hope?â€

â€œAnd the fete at the English ambassadorâ€™s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,â€ said the prince. â€œMy daughter is coming for me to take me there.â€

â€œI thought todayâ€™s fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.â€

â€œIf they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,â€ said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.

â€œDonâ€™t tease! Well, and what has been decided about NovosÃ­ltsevâ€™s dispatch? You know everything.â€

â€œWhat can one say about it?â€ replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. â€œWhat has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.â€

Prince VasÃ­li always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna PÃ¡vlovna SchÃ©rer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.

In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna PÃ¡vlovna burst out:

â€œOh, donâ€™t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I donâ€™t understand things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexanderâ€™s loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer did NovosÃ­ltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I donâ€™t believe a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!â€

She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.

â€œI think,â€ said the prince with a smile, â€œthat if you had been sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of Prussiaâ€™s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?â€

â€œIn a moment. Ã€ propos,â€ she added, becoming calm again, â€œI am expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best French families. He is one of the genuine Ã©migrÃ©s, the good ones. And also the AbbÃ© Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been received by the Emperor. Had you heard?â€

â€œI shall be delighted to meet them,â€ said the prince. â€œBut tell me,â€ he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit, â€œis it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature.â€

Prince VasÃ­li wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying through the Dowager Empress MÃ¡rya FÃ«dorovna to secure it for the baron.

Anna PÃ¡vlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was pleased with.

â€œBaron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,â€ was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.

As she named the Empress, Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke beaucoup dâ€™estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.

The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna PÃ¡vlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she said:

â€œNow about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly beautiful.â€

The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.

â€œI often think,â€ she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversationâ€”â€œI often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I donâ€™t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I donâ€™t like him,â€ she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows. â€œTwo such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so you donâ€™t deserve to have them.â€

And she smiled her ecstatic smile.

â€œI canâ€™t help it,â€ said the prince. â€œLavater would have said I lack the bump of paternity.â€

â€œDonâ€™t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselvesâ€ (and her face assumed its melancholy expression), â€œhe was mentioned at Her Majestyâ€™s and you were pitied....â€

The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly, awaiting a reply. He frowned.

â€œWhat would you have me do?â€ he said at last. â€œYou know I did all a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That is the only difference between them.â€ He said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.

â€œAnd why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father there would be nothing I could reproach you with,â€ said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, looking up pensively.

â€œI am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is how I explain it to myself. It canâ€™t be helped!â€

He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture. Anna PÃ¡vlovna meditated.

â€œHave you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?â€ she asked. â€œThey say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I donâ€™t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess Mary BolkÃ³nskaya.â€

Prince VasÃ­li did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information.

â€œDo you know,â€ he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts, â€œthat Anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year? And,â€ he went on after a pause, â€œwhat will it be in five years, if he goes on like this?â€ Presently he added: â€œThatâ€™s what we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?â€

â€œHer father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is the well-known Prince BolkÃ³nski who had to retire from the army under the late Emperor, and was nicknamed â€˜the King of Prussia.â€™ He is very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately. He is an aide-de-camp of KutÃºzovâ€™s and will be here tonight.â€

â€œListen, dear Annette,â€ said the prince, suddenly taking Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. â€œArrange that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe with an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich and of good family and thatâ€™s all I want.â€

And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the maid of honorâ€™s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.

â€œAttendez,â€ said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, reflecting, â€œIâ€™ll speak to Lise, young BolkÃ³nskiâ€™s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can be arranged. It shall be on your familyâ€™s behalf that Iâ€™ll start my apprenticeship as old maid.â€

CHAPTER II
Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s drawing room was gradually filling. The highest Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged. Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s daughter, the beautiful HÃ©lÃ¨ne, came to take her father to the ambassadorâ€™s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess BolkÃ³nskaya, known as la femme la plus sÃ©duisante de PÃ©tersbourg, * was also there. She had been married during the previous winter, and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced. The AbbÃ© Morio and many others had also come.

* The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.

To each new arrival Anna PÃ¡vlovna said, â€œYou have not yet seen my aunt,â€ or â€œYou do not know my aunt?â€ and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna PÃ¡vlovna mentioned each oneâ€™s name and then left them.

Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them cared about; Anna PÃ¡vlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her Majesty, â€œwho, thank God, was better today.â€ And each visitor, though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening.

The young Princess BolkÃ³nskaya had brought some work in a gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth, but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defectâ€”the shortness of her upper lip and her half-open mouthâ€”seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and carrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a little while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life and health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day.

The little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her. â€œI have brought my work,â€ said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present. â€œMind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,â€ she added, turning to her hostess. â€œYou wrote that it was to be quite a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed.â€ And she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.

â€œSoyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone else,â€ replied Anna PÃ¡vlovna.

â€œYou know,â€ said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in French, turning to a general, â€œmy husband is deserting me? He is going to get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?â€ she added, addressing Prince VasÃ­li, and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful HÃ©lÃ¨ne.

â€œWhat a delightful woman this little princess is!â€ said Prince VasÃ­li to Anna PÃ¡vlovna.

One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout young man was an illegitimate son of Count BezÃºkhov, a well-known grandee of Catherineâ€™s time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his first appearance in society. Anna PÃ¡vlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her face when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.

â€œIt is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor invalid,â€ said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her.

Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.

Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majestyâ€™s health. Anna PÃ¡vlovna in dismay detained him with the words: â€œDo you know the AbbÃ© Morio? He is a most interesting man.â€

â€œYes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very interesting but hardly feasible.â€

â€œYou think so?â€ rejoined Anna PÃ¡vlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbÃ©â€™s plan chimerical.

â€œWe will talk of it later,â€ said Anna PÃ¡vlovna with a smile.

And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna PÃ¡vlovna moved about her drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady, proper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbÃ©.

Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.

CHAPTER III
Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt, beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round the abbÃ©. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful Princess HÃ©lÃ¨ne, Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s daughter, and the little Princess BolkÃ³nskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age. The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna PÃ¡vlovna.

The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself. Anna PÃ¡vlovna was obviously serving him up as a treat to her guests. As a clever maÃ®tre dâ€™hÃ´tel serves up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna PÃ¡vlovna served up to her guests, first the vicomte and then the abbÃ©, as peculiarly choice morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the Duc dâ€™Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc dâ€™Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reasons for Buonaparteâ€™s hatred of him.

â€œAh, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,â€ said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, with a pleasant feeling that there was something Ã  la Louis XV in the sound of that sentence: â€œContez nous Ã§ela, Vicomte.â€

The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to comply. Anna PÃ¡vlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to listen to his tale.

â€œThe vicomte knew the duc personally,â€ whispered Anna PÃ¡vlovna to one of the guests. â€œThe vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,â€ said she to another. â€œHow evidently he belongs to the best society,â€ said she to a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef on a hot dish.

The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.

â€œCome over here, HÃ©lÃ¨ne, dear,â€ said Anna PÃ¡vlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of another group.

The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the roomâ€”the smile of a perfectly beautiful woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosomâ€”which in the fashion of those days were very much exposedâ€”and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna PÃ¡vlovna. HÃ©lÃ¨ne was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect.

â€œHow lovely!â€ said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her unchanging smile.

â€œMadame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,â€ said he, smilingly inclining his head.

The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story was being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm, altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna PÃ¡vlovna, at once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honorâ€™s face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile.

The little princess had also left the tea table and followed HÃ©lÃ¨ne.

â€œWait a moment, Iâ€™ll get my work.... Now then, what are you thinking of?â€ she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. â€œFetch me my workbag.â€

There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat.

â€œNow I am all right,â€ she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she took up her work.

Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.

Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like his sisterâ€™s, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous, self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions.

â€œItâ€™s not going to be a ghost story?â€ said he, sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this instrument he could not begin to speak.

â€œWhy no, my dear fellow,â€ said the astonished narrator, shrugging his shoulders.

â€œBecause I hate ghost stories,â€ said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had uttered them.

He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe effrayÃ©e, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.

The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current, to the effect that the Duc dâ€™Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actressâ€™ favors, and that in his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject, and was thus at the ducâ€™s mercy. The latter spared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.

The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked agitated.

â€œCharming!â€ said Anna PÃ¡vlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princess.

â€œCharming!â€ whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented her from going on with it.

The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue, but just then Anna PÃ¡vlovna, who had kept a watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbÃ©, so she hurried to the rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbÃ© about the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young manâ€™s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why Anna PÃ¡vlovna disapproved.

â€œThe means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the people,â€ the abbÃ© was saying. â€œIt is only necessary for one powerful nation like Russiaâ€”barbaric as she is said to beâ€”to place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the world!â€

â€œBut how are you to get that balance?â€ Pierre was beginning.

At that moment Anna PÃ¡vlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre, asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italianâ€™s face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.

â€œI am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have had the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of the climate,â€ said he.

Not letting the abbÃ© and Pierre escape, Anna PÃ¡vlovna, the more conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the larger circle.

CHAPTER IV
Just then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew BolkÃ³nski, the little princessâ€™ husband. He was a very handsome young man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step, offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them. And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.

â€œYou are off to the war, Prince?â€ said Anna PÃ¡vlovna.

â€œGeneral KutÃºzov,â€ said BolkÃ³nski, speaking French and stressing the last syllable of the generalâ€™s name like a Frenchman, â€œhas been pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....â€

â€œAnd Lise, your wife?â€

â€œShe will go to the country.â€

â€œAre you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?â€

â€œAndrÃ©,â€ said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, â€œthe vicomte has been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!â€

Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierreâ€™s beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.

â€œThere now!... So you, too, are in the great world?â€ said he to Pierre.

â€œI knew you would be here,â€ replied Pierre. â€œI will come to supper with you. May I?â€ he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his story.

â€œNo, impossible!â€ said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierreâ€™s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He wished to say something more, but at that moment Prince VasÃ­li and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.

â€œYou must excuse me, dear Vicomte,â€ said Prince VasÃ­li to the Frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising. â€œThis unfortunate fete at the ambassadorâ€™s deprives me of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave your enchanting party,â€ said he, turning to Anna PÃ¡vlovna.

His daughter, Princess HÃ©lÃ¨ne, passed between the chairs, lightly holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous, almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.

â€œVery lovely,â€ said Prince Andrew.

â€œVery,â€ said Pierre.

In passing Prince VasÃ­li seized Pierreâ€™s hand and said to Anna PÃ¡vlovna: â€œEducate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society. Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever women.â€



Anna PÃ¡vlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his father to be a connection of Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s. The elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince VasÃ­li in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear.

â€œHow about my son BorÃ­s, Prince?â€ said she, hurrying after him into the anteroom. â€œI canâ€™t remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me what news I may take back to my poor boy.â€

Although Prince VasÃ­li listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go away.

â€œWhat would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he would be transferred to the Guards at once?â€ said she.

â€œBelieve me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,â€ answered Prince VasÃ­li, â€œbut it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should advise you to appeal to RumyÃ¡ntsev through Prince GolÃ­tsyn. That would be the best way.â€

The elderly lady was a Princess DrubetskÃ¡ya, belonging to one of the best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections. She had now come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son. It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince VasÃ­li that she had obtained an invitation to Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s reception and had sat listening to the vicomteâ€™s story. Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s words frightened her, an embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment; then she smiled again and clutched Prince VasÃ­liâ€™s arm more tightly.

â€œListen to me, Prince,â€ said she. â€œI have never yet asked you for anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my fatherâ€™s friendship for you; but now I entreat you for Godâ€™s sake to do this for my sonâ€”and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,â€ she added hurriedly. â€œNo, donâ€™t be angry, but promise! I have asked GolÃ­tsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always were,â€ she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.

â€œPapa, we shall be late,â€ said Princess HÃ©lÃ¨ne, turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door.

Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last. Prince VasÃ­li knew this, and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence. But in Princess DrubetskÃ¡yaâ€™s case he felt, after her second appeal, something like qualms of conscience. She had reminded him of what was quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career. Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of those womenâ€”mostly mothersâ€”who, having once made up their minds, will not rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even to make scenes. This last consideration moved him.

â€œMy dear Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna,â€ said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone, â€œit is almost impossible for me to do what you ask; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your fatherâ€™s memory, I will do the impossibleâ€”your son shall be transferred to the Guards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?â€

â€œMy dear benefactor! This is what I expected from youâ€”I knew your kindness!â€ He turned to go.

â€œWaitâ€”just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...â€ she faltered. â€œYou are on good terms with Michael IlariÃ³novich KutÃºzov ... recommend BorÃ­s to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at rest, and then...â€

Prince VasÃ­li smiled.

â€œNo, I wonâ€™t promise that. You donâ€™t know how KutÃºzov is pestered since his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants.â€

â€œNo, but do promise! I wonâ€™t let you go! My dear benefactor...â€

â€œPapa,â€ said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before, â€œwe shall be late.â€

â€œWell, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?â€

â€œThen tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?â€

â€œCertainly; but about KutÃºzov, I donâ€™t promise.â€

â€œDo promise, do promise, VasÃ­li!â€ cried Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna as he went, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably came naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.

Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold, artificial expression. She returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her task was accomplished.

CHAPTER V
â€œAnd what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at Milan?â€ asked Anna PÃ¡vlovna, â€œand of the comedy of the people of Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations? Adorable! It is enough to make oneâ€™s head whirl! It is as if the whole world had gone crazy.â€

Prince Andrew looked Anna PÃ¡vlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile.

â€œâ€˜Dieu me la donne, gare Ã  qui la touche!â€™â€™ * They say he was very fine when he said that,â€ he remarked, repeating the words in Italian: â€œâ€˜Dio mi lâ€™ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!â€™â€™

* God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!

â€œI hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over,â€ Anna PÃ¡vlovna continued. â€œThe sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everything.â€

â€œThe sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,â€ said the vicomte, polite but hopeless: â€œThe sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!â€ and he became more animated. â€œAnd believe me, they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper.â€

And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.

Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the CondÃ© coat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it.

â€œBÃ¢ton de gueules, engrÃªlÃ© de gueules dâ€™azurâ€”maison CondÃ©,â€ said he.

The princess listened, smiling.

â€œIf Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer,â€ the vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts, â€œthings will have gone too far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French societyâ€”I mean good French societyâ€”will have been forever destroyed, and then....â€

He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna PÃ¡vlovna, who had him under observation, interrupted:

â€œThe Emperor Alexander,â€ said she, with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, â€œhas declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose their own form of government; and I believe that once free from the usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king,â€ she concluded, trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant.

â€œThat is doubtful,â€ said Prince Andrew. â€œMonsieur le Vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it will be difficult to return to the old regime.â€

â€œFrom what I have heard,â€ said Pierre, blushing and breaking into the conversation, â€œalmost all the aristocracy has already gone over to Bonaparteâ€™s side.â€

â€œIt is the Buonapartists who say that,â€ replied the vicoite vithktt lkmkine at Piepre. â€œAd tha preraft thma it iq dhffibuld to kngw the raal state of French pqblic kpinikj.â€

Befo e Anna PÃ¡vlovna and the otheps had timd to bmile their `ppreci!tikn of the pic/mtdâ€™s epigpam, P`ar0e agail b2oke into the conversation, and though Anna PÃ¡vlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.

â€œThe execution of the Duc dâ€™Enghien,â€ declared Monsieur Pierre, â€œwas a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deed.â€

â€œDieu! Mon Dieu!â€ muttered Anna PÃ¡vlovna in a terrified whisper.

â€œWhat, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul?â€ said the little princess, smiling and drawing her work nearer to her.

â€œOh! Oh!â€ exclaimed several voices.

â€œCapital!â€ said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his knee with the palm of his hand.

The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at his audience over his spectacles and continued.

â€œI say so,â€ he continued desperately, â€œbecause the Bourbons fled from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good, he could not stop short for the sake of one manâ€™s life.â€

â€œWonâ€™t you come over to the other table?â€ suggested Anna PÃ¡vlovna.

But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.

â€œNo,â€ cried he, becoming more and more eager, â€œNapoleon is great because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses, preserved all that was good in itâ€”equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the pressâ€”and only for that reason did he obtain power.â€

â€œYes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have called him a great man,â€ remarked the vicomte.

â€œHe could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man. The Revolution was a grand thing!â€ continued Monsieur Pierre, betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.

â€œWhat? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that... But wonâ€™t you come to this other table?â€ repeated Anna PÃ¡vlovna.

â€œRousseauâ€™s Contrat Social,â€ said the vicomte with a tolerant smile.

â€œI am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.â€

â€œYes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,â€ again interjected an ironical voice.

â€œThose were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon has retained in full force.â€

â€œLiberty and equality,â€ said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were, â€œhigh-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who does not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and equality. Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the contrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.â€

Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of Pierreâ€™s outburst Anna PÃ¡vlovna, despite her social experience, was horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierreâ€™s sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator.

â€œBut, my dear Monsieur Pierre,â€ said she, â€œhow do you explain the fact of a great man executing a ducâ€”or even an ordinary man whoâ€”is innocent and untried?â€

â€œI should like,â€ said the vicomte, â€œto ask how monsieur explains the 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not at all like the conduct of a great man!â€

â€œAnd the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!â€ said the little princess, shrugging her shoulders.

â€œHeâ€™s a low fellow, say what you will,â€ remarked Prince Hippolyte.

Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled. His smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled, his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by anotherâ€”a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to ask forgiveness.

The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested. All were silent.

â€œHow do you expect him to answer you all at once?â€ said Prince Andrew. â€œBesides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor. So it seems to me.â€

â€œYes, yes, of course!â€ Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement.

â€œOne must admit,â€ continued Prince Andrew, â€œthat Napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but ... but there are other acts which it is difficult to justify.â€

Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of Pierreâ€™s remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go.

Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend, and asking them all to be seated began:

â€œI was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it. Excuse me, Vicomteâ€”I must tell it in Russian or the point will be lost....â€ And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia. Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his story.

â€œThere is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She must have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was her taste. And she had a ladyâ€™s maid, also big. She said....â€

Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty.

â€œShe said.... Oh yes! She said, â€˜Girl,â€™ to the maid, â€˜put on a livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some calls.â€™â€

Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator. Several persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna PÃ¡vlovna, did however smile.

â€œShe went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat and her long hair came down....â€ Here he could contain himself no longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: â€œAnd the whole world knew....â€

And so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had told it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna PÃ¡vlovna and the others appreciated Prince Hippolyteâ€™s social tact in so agreeably ending Pierreâ€™s unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and where.

CHAPTER VI
Having thanked Anna PÃ¡vlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began to take their leave.

Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something particularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he was absent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the generalâ€™s three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume, till the general asked him to restore it. All his absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was, however, redeemed by his kindly, simple, and modest expression. Anna PÃ¡vlovna turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion, nodded and said: â€œI hope to see you again, but I also hope you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre.â€

When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, â€œOpinions are opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am.â€ And everyone, including Anna PÃ¡vlovna, felt this.

Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened indifferently to his wifeâ€™s chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also come into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.

â€œGo in, Annette, or you will catch cold,â€ said the little princess, taking leave of Anna PÃ¡vlovna. â€œIt is settled,â€ she added in a low voice.

Anna PÃ¡vlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she contemplated between Anatole and the little princessâ€™ sister-in-law.

â€œI rely on you, my dear,â€ said Anna PÃ¡vlovna, also in a low tone. â€œWrite to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter. Au revoir! â€â€”and she left the hall.

Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face close to her, began to whisper something.

Two footmen, the princessâ€™ and his own, stood holding a shawl and a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened to the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so. The princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.

â€œI am very glad I did not go to the ambassadorâ€™s,â€ said Prince Hippolyte â€œâ€”so dullâ€”. It has been a delightful evening, has it not? Delightful!â€

â€œThey say the ball will be very good,â€ replied the princess, drawing up her downy little lip. â€œAll the pretty women in society will be there.â€

â€œNot all, for you will not be there; not all,â€ said Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either from awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as though embracing her.

Still smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at her husband. Prince Andrewâ€™s eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did he seem.

â€œAre you ready?â€ he asked his wife, looking past her.

Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch following the princess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage.

â€œPrincesse, au revoir,â€ cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet.

The princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince Hippolyte, under pretense of helping, was in everyoneâ€™s way.

â€œAllow me, sir,â€ said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold, disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.

â€œI am expecting you, Pierre,â€ said the same voice, but gently and affectionately.

The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home.

â€œWell, mon cher,â€ said the vicomte, having seated himself beside Hippolyte in the carriage, â€œyour little princess is very nice, very nice indeed, quite French,â€ and he kissed the tips of his fingers. Hippolyte burst out laughing.

â€œDo you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,â€ continued the vicomte. â€œI pity the poor husband, that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch.â€

Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, â€œAnd you were saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One has to know how to deal with them.â€

Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrewâ€™s study like one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was Caesarâ€™s Commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it in the middle.

â€œWhat have you done to Mlle SchÃ©rer? She will be quite ill now,â€ said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white hands.

Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted his eager face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.

â€œThat abbÃ© is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light.... In my opinion perpetual peace is possible butâ€”I do not know how to express it ... not by a balance of political power....â€

It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract conversation.

â€œOne canâ€™t everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher. Well, have you at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist?â€ asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.

Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.

â€œReally, I donâ€™t yet know. I donâ€™t like either the one or the other.â€

â€œBut you must decide on something! Your father expects it.â€

Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbÃ© as tutor, and had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow his father dismissed the abbÃ© and said to the young man, â€œNow go to Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to anything. Here is a letter to Prince VasÃ­li, and here is money. Write to me all about it, and I will help you in everything.â€ Pierre had already been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided on anything. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking. Pierre rubbed his forehead.

â€œBut he must be a Freemason,â€ said he, referring to the abbÃ© whom he had met that evening.

â€œThat is all nonsense.â€ Prince Andrew again interrupted him, â€œlet us talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?â€

â€œNo, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to tell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army; but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is not right.â€

Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierreâ€™s childish words. He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naÃ¯ve question.

â€œIf no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no wars,â€ he said.

â€œAnd that would be splendid,â€ said Pierre.

Prince Andrew smiled ironically.

â€œVery likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about....â€

â€œWell, why are you going to the war?â€ asked Pierre.

â€œWhat for? I donâ€™t know. I must. Besides that I am going....â€ He paused. â€œI am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me!â€

CHAPTER VII
The rustle of a womanâ€™s dress was heard in the next room. Prince Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it had had in Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s drawing room. Pierre removed his feet from the sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her.

â€œHow is it,â€ she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair, â€œhow is it Annette never got married? How stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for saying so, but you have no sense about women. What an argumentative fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!â€

â€œAnd I am still arguing with your husband. I canâ€™t understand why he wants to go to the war,â€ replied Pierre, addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young women.

The princess started. Evidently Pierreâ€™s words touched her to the quick.

â€œAh, that is just what I tell him!â€ said she. â€œI donâ€™t understand it; I donâ€™t in the least understand why men canâ€™t live without wars. How is it that we women donâ€™t want anything of the kind, donâ€™t need it? Now you shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here he is Uncleâ€™s aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position. He is so well known, so much appreciated by everyone. The other day at the AprÃ¡ksinsâ€™ I heard a lady asking, â€˜Is that the famous Prince Andrew?â€™ I did indeed.â€ She laughed. â€œHe is so well received everywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously. Annette and I were speaking of how to arrange it. What do you think?â€

Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the conversation, gave no reply.

â€œWhen are you starting?â€ he asked.

â€œOh, donâ€™t speak of his going, donâ€™t! I wonâ€™t hear it spoken of,â€ said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member. â€œToday when I remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off ... and then you know, AndrÃ©...â€ (she looked significantly at her husband) â€œIâ€™m afraid, Iâ€™m afraid!â€ she whispered, and a shudder ran down her back.

Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a tone of frigid politeness.

â€œWhat is it you are afraid of, Lise? I donâ€™t understand,â€ said he.

â€œThere, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone in the country.â€

â€œWith my father and sister, remember,â€ said Prince Andrew gently.

â€œAlone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to be afraid.â€

Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the gist of the matter lay in that.

â€œI still canâ€™t understand what you are afraid of,â€ said Prince Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.

The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.

â€œNo, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have....â€

â€œYour doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,â€ said Prince Andrew. â€œYou had better go.â€

The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.

Pierre looked over his spectacles with naÃ¯ve surprise, now at him and now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.

â€œWhy should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?â€ exclaimed the little princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace. â€œI have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no pity for me. Why is it?â€

â€œLise!â€ was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed an entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself regret her words. But she went on hurriedly:

â€œYou treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you behave like that six months ago?â€

â€œLise, I beg you to desist,â€ said Prince Andrew still more emphatically.

Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.

â€œCalm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because.... I assure you I myself have experienced ... and so ... because ... No, excuse me! An outsider is out of place here.... No, donâ€™t distress yourself.... Good-by!â€

Prince Andrew caught him by the hand.

â€œNo, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you.â€

â€œNo, he thinks only of himself,â€ muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears.

â€œLise!â€ said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted.

Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princessâ€™ pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husbandâ€™s face, and her own assumed the timid, deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail.

â€œMon Dieu, mon Dieu!â€ she muttered, and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.

â€œGood night, Lise,â€ said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger.

CHAPTER VIII
The friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand.

â€œLet us go and have supper,â€ he said with a sigh, going to the door.

They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room. Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married. Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and, with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on his face, began to talkâ€”as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out.

â€œNever, never marry, my dear fellow! Thatâ€™s my advice: never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of, and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothingâ€”or all that is good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles. Yes! Yes! Yes! Donâ€™t look at me with such surprise. If you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot!... But whatâ€™s the good?...â€ and he waved his arm.

Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend in amazement.

â€œMy wife,â€ continued Prince Andrew, â€œis an excellent woman, one of those rare women with whom a manâ€™s honor is safe; but, O God, what would I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to whom I mention this, because I like you.â€

As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that BolkÃ³nski who had lolled in Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s easy chairs and with half-closed eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant light. It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation.

â€œYou donâ€™t understand why I say this,â€ he continued, â€œbut it is the whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career,â€ said he (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), â€œbut Bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing but his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself up with a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and trivialityâ€”these are the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I am now going to the war, the greatest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic wit,â€ continued Prince Andrew, â€œand at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s they listen to me. And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women.... If you only knew what those society women are, and women in general! My father is right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everythingâ€”thatâ€™s what women are when you see them in their true colors! When you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them, but thereâ€™s nothing, nothing, nothing! No, donâ€™t marry, my dear fellow; donâ€™t marry!â€ concluded Prince Andrew.

â€œIt seems funny to me,â€ said Pierre, â€œthat you, you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have everything before you, everything. And you....â€

He did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.

â€œHow can he talk like that?â€ thought Pierre. He considered his friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might be best described as strength of will. Pierre was always astonished at Prince Andrewâ€™s calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything, and had an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for work and study. And if Pierre was often struck by Andrewâ€™s lack of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he himself was particularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength.

Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly.

â€œMy part is played out,â€ said Prince Andrew. â€œWhatâ€™s the use of talking about me? Let us talk about you,â€ he added after a silence, smiling at his reassuring thoughts.

That smile was immediately reflected on Pierreâ€™s face.

â€œBut what is there to say about me?â€ said Pierre, his face relaxing into a careless, merry smile. â€œWhat am I? An illegitimate son!â€ He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this. â€œWithout a name and without means... And it really...â€ But he did not say what â€œit reallyâ€ was. â€œFor the present I am free and am all right. Only I havenâ€™t the least idea what I am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously.â€

Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glanceâ€”friendly and affectionate as it wasâ€”expressed a sense of his own superiority.

â€œI am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among our whole set. Yes, youâ€™re all right! Choose what you will; itâ€™s all the same. Youâ€™ll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up visiting those KurÃ¡gins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so badlyâ€”all this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!â€

â€œWhat would you have, my dear fellow?â€ answered Pierre, shrugging his shoulders. â€œWomen, my dear fellow; women!â€

â€œI donâ€™t understand it,â€ replied Prince Andrew. â€œWomen who are comme il faut, thatâ€™s a different matter; but the KurÃ¡ginsâ€™ set of women, â€˜women and wineâ€™ I donâ€™t understand!â€

Pierre was staying at Prince VasÃ­li KurÃ¡ginâ€™s and sharing the dissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to Prince Andrewâ€™s sister.

â€œDo you know?â€ said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy thought, â€œseriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading such a life I canâ€™t decide or think properly about anything. Oneâ€™s head aches, and one spends all oneâ€™s money. He asked me for tonight, but I wonâ€™t go.â€

â€œYou give me your word of honor not to go?â€

â€œOn my honor!â€

CHAPTER IX
It was past one oâ€™clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night. On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole KurÃ¡gin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which there was generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of.

â€œI should like to go to KurÃ¡ginâ€™s,â€ thought he.

But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go there. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it he had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering; â€œbesides,â€ thought he, â€œall such â€˜words of honorâ€™ are conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same!â€ Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying all his decisions and intentions. He went to KurÃ¡ginâ€™s.

Reaching the large house near the Horse Guardsâ€™ barracks, in which Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs, and went in at the open door. There was no one in the anteroom; empty bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance.

Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed. Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses. From the third room came sounds of laughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and general commotion. Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window. Three others were romping with a young bear, one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others.

â€œI bet a hundred on Stevens!â€ shouted one.

â€œMind, no holding on!â€ cried another.

â€œI bet on DÃ³lokhov!â€ cried a third. â€œKurÃ¡gin, you part our hands.â€

â€œThere, leave Bruin alone; hereâ€™s a bet on.â€

â€œAt one draught, or he loses!â€ shouted a fourth.

â€œJacob, bring a bottle!â€ shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine linen shirt unfastened in front. â€œWait a bit, you fellows.... Here is PÃ©tya! Good man!â€ cried he, addressing Pierre.

Another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes, particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring, cried from the window: â€œCome here; part the bets!â€ This was DÃ³lokhov, an officer of the SemÃ«nov regiment, a notorious gambler and duelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about him merrily.

â€œI donâ€™t understand. Whatâ€™s it all about?â€

â€œWait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here,â€ said Anatole, and taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.

â€œFirst of all you must drink!â€

Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening to their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierreâ€™s glass while explaining that DÃ³lokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.

â€œGo on, you must drink it all,â€ said Anatole, giving Pierre the last glass, â€œor I wonâ€™t let you go!â€

â€œNo, I wonâ€™t,â€ said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up to the window.

DÃ³lokhov was holding the Englishmanâ€™s hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to Anatole and Pierre.

DÃ³lokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. He was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache, so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face. DÃ³lokhov was a man of small means and no connections. Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles, DÃ³lokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them, including Anatole himself, respected him more than they did Anatole. DÃ³lokhov could play all games and nearly always won. However much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness. Both KurÃ¡gin and DÃ³lokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg.

The bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around.

Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted to smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but could not move it. He smashed a pane.

â€œYou have a try, Hercules,â€ said he, turning to Pierre.

Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with a crash.

â€œTake it right out, or theyâ€™ll think Iâ€™m holding on,â€ said DÃ³lokhov.

â€œIs the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?â€ said Anatole.

â€œFirst-rate,â€ said Pierre, looking at DÃ³lokhov, who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.

DÃ³lokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window sill. â€œListen!â€ cried he, standing there and addressing those in the room. All were silent.

â€œI bet fifty imperialsâ€â€”he spoke French that the Englishman might understand him, but he did not speak it very wellâ€”â€œI bet fifty imperials ... or do you wish to make it a hundred?â€ added he, addressing the Englishman.

â€œNo, fifty,â€ replied the latter.

â€œAll right. Fifty imperials ... that I will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this spotâ€ (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window) â€œand without holding on to anything. Is that right?â€

â€œQuite right,â€ said the Englishman.

Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at himâ€”the Englishman was shortâ€”began repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.

â€œWait!â€ cried DÃ³lokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention. â€œWait a bit, KurÃ¡gin. Listen! If anyone else does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you understand?â€

The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and though he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating DÃ³lokhovâ€™s words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window sill, leaned over, and looked down.

â€œOh! Oh! Oh!â€ he muttered, looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement.

â€œShut up!â€ cried DÃ³lokhov, pushing him away from the window. The lad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.

Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily, DÃ³lokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill, though it was already quite light. DÃ³lokhovâ€™s back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit up from both sides. Everyone crowded to the window, the Englishman in front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man, older than the others present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of DÃ³lokhovâ€™s shirt.

â€œI say, this is folly! Heâ€™ll be killed,â€ said this more sensible man.

Anatole stopped him.

â€œDonâ€™t touch him! Youâ€™ll startle him and then heâ€™ll be killed. Eh?... What then?... Eh?â€

DÃ³lokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged himself on his seat.

â€œIf anyone comes meddling again,â€ said he, emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips, â€œI will throw him down there. Now then!â€

Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from DÃ³lokhovâ€™s back. Anatole stood erect with staring eyes. The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear. All were still. Pierre took his hands from his eyes. DÃ³lokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort. The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back. â€œWhy is it so long?â€ thought Pierre. It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed. Suddenly DÃ³lokhov made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and arm wavered still more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch the window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never open them again. Suddenly he was aware of a stir all around. He looked up: DÃ³lokhov was standing on the window sill, with a pale but radiant face.

â€œItâ€™s empty.â€

He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly. DÃ³lokhov jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.

â€œWell done!... Fine fellow!... Thereâ€™s a bet for you!... Devil take you!â€ came from different sides.

The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money. DÃ³lokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon the window sill.

â€œGentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? Iâ€™ll do the same thing!â€ he suddenly cried. â€œEven without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a bottle. Iâ€™ll do it.... Bring a bottle!â€

â€œLet him do it, let him do it,â€ said DÃ³lokhov, smiling.

â€œWhat next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why, you go giddy even on a staircase,â€ exclaimed several voices.

â€œIâ€™ll drink it! Letâ€™s have a bottle of rum!â€ shouted Pierre, banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window.

They seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flying.

â€œNo, youâ€™ll never manage him that way,â€ said Anatole. â€œWait a bit and Iâ€™ll get round him.... Listen! Iâ€™ll take your bet tomorrow, but now we are all going to â€”â€”â€™s.â€

â€œCome on then,â€ cried Pierre. â€œCome on!... And weâ€™ll take Bruin with us.â€

And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground, and began dancing round the room with it.

CHAPTER X
Prince VasÃ­li kept the promise he had given to Princess DrubetskÃ¡ya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son BorÃ­s on the evening of Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s soiree. The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an exception made, and BorÃ­s transferred into the regiment of SemÃ«nov Guards with the rank of cornet. He received, however, no appointment to KutÃºzovâ€™s staff despite all Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâ€™s endeavors and entreaties. Soon after Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s reception Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the RostÃ³vs, with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling BÃ³ry, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time. The Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had remained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to RadzivÃ­lov.

It was St. Nataliaâ€™s day and the name day of two of the RostÃ³vsâ€”the mother and the youngest daughterâ€”both named Nataly. Ever since the morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually, bringing visitors to the Countess RostÃ³vaâ€™s big house on the PovarskÃ¡ya, so well known to all Moscow. The countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in relays.

The countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental type of face, evidently worn out with childbearingâ€”she had had twelve. A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna DrubetskÃ¡ya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors. The young people were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors. The count met the guests and saw them off, inviting them all to dinner.

â€œI am very, very grateful to you, mon cher,â€ or â€œma chÃ¨reâ€â€”he called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone, â€œmy dear,â€ whether they were above or below him in rankâ€”â€œI thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended, ma chÃ¨re! On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come, mon cher!â€ These words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation, and with the same expression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven face, the same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows. As soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and fro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or touched on questions of health, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but self-confident French; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner. Sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall, where tables were being set out for eighty people; and looking at the footmen, who were bringing in silver and china, moving tables, and unfolding damask table linen, he would call DmÃ­tri VasÃ­levich, a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say: â€œWell, DmÃ­tri, youâ€™ll see that things are all as they should be? Thatâ€™s right! The great thing is the serving, thatâ€™s it.â€ And with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room.

â€œMÃ¡rya LvÃ³vna KarÃ¡gina and her daughter!â€ announced the countessâ€™ gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing room. The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her husbandâ€™s portrait on it.

â€œIâ€™m quite worn out by these callers. However, Iâ€™ll see her and no more. She is so affected. Ask her in,â€ she said to the footman in a sad voice, as if saying: â€œVery well, finish me off.â€

A tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.

â€œDear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child ... at the RazumÃ³vskiâ€™s ball ... and Countess AprÃ¡ksina ... I was so delighted...â€ came the sounds of animated feminine voices, interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs. Then one of those conversations began which last out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say, â€œI am so delighted... Mammaâ€™s health... and Countess AprÃ¡ksina...â€ and then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, put on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The conversation was on the chief topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of Catherineâ€™s day, Count BezÃºkhov, and about his illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna PÃ¡vlovnaâ€™s reception.

â€œI am so sorry for the poor count,â€ said the visitor. â€œHe is in such bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him!â€

â€œWhat is that?â€ asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of Count BezÃºkhovâ€™s distress some fifteen times.

â€œThatâ€™s what comes of a modern education,â€ exclaimed the visitor. â€œIt seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the police.â€

â€œYou donâ€™t say so!â€ replied the countess.

â€œHe chose his friends badly,â€ interposed Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. â€œPrince VasÃ­liâ€™s son, he, and a certain DÃ³lokhov have, it is said, been up to heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it. DÃ³lokhov has been degraded to the ranks and BezÃºkhovâ€™s son sent back to Moscow. Anatole KurÃ¡ginâ€™s father managed somehow to get his sonâ€™s affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg.â€

â€œBut what have they been up to?â€ asked the countess.

â€œThey are regular brigands, especially DÃ³lokhov,â€ replied the visitor. â€œHe is a son of MÃ¡rya IvÃ¡novna DÃ³lokhova, such a worthy woman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere, put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The police tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka Canal. And there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back!â€

â€œWhat a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!â€ shouted the count, dying with laughter.

â€œOh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?â€

Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.

â€œIt was all they could do to rescue the poor man,â€ continued the visitor. â€œAnd to think it is Cyril VladÃ­mirovich BezÃºkhovâ€™s son who amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so well educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education has done for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in spite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite declined: I have my daughters to consider.â€

â€œWhy do you say this young man is so rich?â€ asked the countess, turning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention. â€œHis children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also is illegitimate.â€

The visitor made a gesture with her hand.

â€œI should think he has a score of them.â€

Princess Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna intervened in the conversation, evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society.

â€œThe fact of the matter is,â€ said she significantly, and also in a half whisper, â€œeveryone knows Count Cyrilâ€™s reputation.... He has lost count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.â€

â€œHow handsome the old man still was only a year ago!â€ remarked the countess. â€œI have never seen a handsomer man.â€

â€œHe is very much altered now,â€ said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna. â€œWell, as I was saying, Prince VasÃ­li is the next heir through his wife, but the count is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to the Emperor about him; so that in the case of his deathâ€”and he is so ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from Petersburgâ€”no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre or Prince VasÃ­li. Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know it all very well for Prince VasÃ­li told me himself. Besides, Cyril VladÃ­mirovich is my motherâ€™s second cousin. Heâ€™s also my BÃ³ryâ€™s godfather,â€ she added, as if she attached no importance at all to the fact.

â€œPrince VasÃ­li arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on some inspection business,â€ remarked the visitor.

â€œYes, but between ourselves,â€ said the princess, â€œthat is a pretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril VladÃ­mirovich, hearing how ill he is.â€

â€œBut do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke,â€ said the count; and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to the young ladies. â€œI can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut!â€

And as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who always eats well and, in particular, drinks well. â€œSo do come and dine with us!â€ he said.

CHAPTER XI
Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably, but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their leave. The visitorâ€™s daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock, darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It was evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far. Behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short jacket.

The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in.

â€œAh, here she is!â€ he exclaimed laughing. â€œMy pet, whose name day it is. My dear pet!â€

â€œMa chÃ¨re, there is a time for everything,â€ said the countess with feigned severity. â€œYou spoil her, IlyÃ¡,â€ she added, turning to her husband.

â€œHow do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name day,â€ said the visitor. â€œWhat a charming child,â€ she added, addressing the mother.

This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of lifeâ€”with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippersâ€”was just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not yet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her motherâ€™s mantillaâ€”not paying the least attention to her severe remarkâ€”and began to laugh. She laughed, and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the folds of her frock.

â€œDo you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...â€ was all NatÃ¡sha managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even the prim visitor could not help joining in.

â€œNow then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,â€ said the mother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning to the visitor she added: â€œShe is my youngest girl.â€

NatÃ¡sha, raising her face for a moment from her motherâ€™s mantilla, glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.

The visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it necessary to take some part in it.

â€œTell me, my dear,â€ said she to NatÃ¡sha, â€œis Mimi a relation of yours? A daughter, I suppose?â€

NatÃ¡sha did not like the visitorâ€™s tone of condescension to childish things. She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.

Meanwhile the younger generation: BorÃ­s, the officer, Anna MikhÃ¡ylovnaâ€™s son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the countâ€™s eldest son; SÃ³nya, the countâ€™s fifteen-year-old niece, and little PÃ©tya, his youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently in the back rooms, from which they had dashed out so impetuously, the conversation had been more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals, the weather, and Countess AprÃ¡ksina. Now and then they glanced at one another, hardly able to suppress their laughter.

The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood, were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike. BorÃ­s was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression. Dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room. He evidently tried to find something to say, but failed. BorÃ­s on the contrary at once found his footing, and related quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged during the five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked right across the skull. Having said this he glanced at NatÃ¡sha. She turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother, who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and unable to control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry her. BorÃ­s did not laugh.

â€œYou were meaning to go out, werenâ€™t you, Mamma? Do you want the carriage?â€ he asked his mother with a smile.

â€œYes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready,â€ she answered, returning his smile.

BorÃ­s quietly left the room and went in search of NatÃ¡sha. The plump boy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been disturbed.

CHAPTER XII
The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the young lady visitor and the countessâ€™ eldest daughter (who was four years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person), were Nicholas and SÃ³nya, the niece. SÃ³nya was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck. By the grace of her movements, by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a pretty, half-grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat. She evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could, like NatÃ¡sha and BorÃ­s, escape from the drawing room.

â€œAh yes, my dear,â€ said the count, addressing the visitor and pointing to Nicholas, â€œhis friend BorÃ­s has become an officer, and so for friendshipâ€™s sake he is leaving the university and me, his old father, and entering the military service, my dear. And there was a place and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department! Isnâ€™t that friendship?â€ remarked the count in an inquiring tone.

â€œBut they say that war has been declared,â€ replied the visitor.

â€œTheyâ€™ve been saying so a long while,â€ said the count, â€œand theyâ€™ll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it. My dear, thereâ€™s friendship for you,â€ he repeated. â€œHeâ€™s joining the hussars.â€

The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.

â€œItâ€™s not at all from friendship,â€ declared Nicholas, flaring up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. â€œIt is not from friendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation.â€

He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were both regarding him with a smile of approbation.

â€œSchubert, the colonel of the PÃ¡vlograd Hussars, is dining with us today. He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him. It canâ€™t be helped!â€ said the count, shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.

â€œI have already told you, Papa,â€ said his son, â€œthat if you donâ€™t wish to let me go, Iâ€™ll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere except in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.â€”I donâ€™t know how to hide what I feel.â€ As he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at SÃ³nya and the young lady visitor.

The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.

â€œAll right, all right!â€ said the old count. â€œHe always flares up! This Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he rose from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,â€ he added, not noticing his visitorâ€™s sarcastic smile.

The elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie KarÃ¡gina turned to young RostÃ³v.

â€œWhat a pity you werenâ€™t at the ArkhÃ¡rovsâ€™ on Thursday. It was so dull without you,â€ said she, giving him a tender smile.

The young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of SÃ³nya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk he glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry glance, and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips, she got up and left the room. All Nicholasâ€™ animation vanished. He waited for the first pause in the conversation, and then with a distressed face left the room to find SÃ³nya.

â€œHow plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves!â€ said Anna MikhÃ¡ylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out. â€œCousinageâ€”dangereux voisinage,â€ * she added.

* Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.

â€œYes,â€ said the countess when the brightness these young people had brought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question no one had put but which was always in her mind, â€œand how much suffering, how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy. One is always, always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both for girls and boys.â€

â€œIt all depends on the bringing up,â€ remarked the visitor.

â€œYes, youâ€™re quite right,â€ continued the countess. â€œTill now I have always, thank God, been my childrenâ€™s friend and had their full confidence,â€ said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets from them. â€œI know I shall always be my daughtersâ€™ first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with his impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy canâ€™t help it), he will all the same never be like those Petersburg young men.â€

â€œYes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,â€ chimed in the count, who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that everything was splendid. â€œJust fancy: wants to be an hussar. Whatâ€™s one to do, my dear?â€

â€œWhat a charming creature your younger girl is,â€ said the visitor; â€œa little volcano!â€

â€œYes, a regular volcano,â€ said the count. â€œTakes after me! And what a voice she has; though sheâ€™s my daughter, I tell the truth when I say sheâ€™ll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an Italian to give her lessons.â€

â€œIsnâ€™t she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train it at that age.â€

â€œOh no, not at all too young!â€ replied the count. â€œWhy, our mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.â€

â€œAnd sheâ€™s in love with BorÃ­s already. Just fancy!â€ said the countess with a gentle smile, looking at BorÃ­s and went on, evidently concerned with a thought that always occupied her: â€œNow you see if I were to be severe with her and to forbid it ... goodness knows what they might be up to on the slyâ€ (she meant that they would be kissing), â€œbut as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come running to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I spoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister I was stricter.â€

â€œYes, I was brought up quite differently,â€ remarked the handsome elder daughter, Countess VÃ©ra, with a smile.

But the smile did not enhance VÃ©raâ€™s beauty as smiles generally do; on the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant, expression. VÃ©ra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyoneâ€”the visitors and countess alikeâ€”turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it, and they all felt awkward.

â€œPeople are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them,â€ said the visitor.

â€œWhatâ€™s the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too clever with VÃ©ra,â€ said the count. â€œWell, what of that? Sheâ€™s turned out splendidly all the same,â€ he added, winking at VÃ©ra.

The guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to dinner.

â€œWhat manners! I thought they would never go,â€ said the countess, when she had seen her guests out.
