CHAPTER XI
Next day he woke late. Recalling his recent impressions, the first thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to the Emperor Francis; he remembered the Minister of War, the polite Austrian adjutant, BilÃ­bin, and last nightâ€™s conversation. Having dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform, which he had not worn for a long time, he went into BilÃ­binâ€™s study fresh, animated, and handsome, with his hand bandaged. In the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps. With Prince Hippolyte KurÃ¡gin, who was a secretary to the embassy, BolkÃ³nski was already acquainted. BilÃ­bin introduced him to the others.

The gentlemen assembled at BilÃ­binâ€™s were young, wealthy, gay society men, who here, as in Vienna, formed a special set which BilÃ­bin, their leader, called les nÃ´tres. * This set, consisting almost exclusively of diplomats, evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with war or politics but related to high society, to certain women, and to the official side of the service. These gentlemen received Prince Andrew as one of themselves, an honor they did not extend to many. From politeness and to start conversation, they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle, and then the talk went off into merry jests and gossip.

* Ours.

â€œBut the best of it was,â€ said one, telling of the misfortune of a fellow diplomat, â€œthat the Chancellor told him flatly that his appointment to London was a promotion and that he was so to regard it. Can you fancy the figure he cut?...â€

â€œBut the worst of it, gentlemenâ€”I am giving KurÃ¡gin away to youâ€”is that that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked fellow, is taking advantage of it!â€

Prince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its arm. He began to laugh.

â€œTell me about that!â€ he said.

â€œOh, you Don Juan! You serpent!â€ cried several voices.

â€œYou, BolkÃ³nski, donâ€™t know,â€ said BilÃ­bin turning to Prince Andrew, â€œthat all the atrocities of the French army (I nearly said of the Russian army) are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among the women!â€

â€œLa femme est la compagne de lâ€™homme,â€ * announced Prince Hippolyte, and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs.

* â€œWoman is manâ€™s companion.â€

BilÃ­bin and the rest of â€œoursâ€ burst out laughing in Hippolyteâ€™s face, and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of whomâ€”he had to admitâ€”he had almost been jealous on his wifeâ€™s account, was the butt of this set.

â€œOh, I must give you a treat,â€ BilÃ­bin whispered to BolkÃ³nski. â€œKurÃ¡gin is exquisite when he discusses politicsâ€”you should see his gravity!â€

He sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking to him about politics. Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these two.

â€œThe Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance,â€ began Hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others, â€œwithout expressing... as in its last note... you understand... Besides, unless His Majesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance...

â€œWait, I have not finished...â€ he said to Prince Andrew, seizing him by the arm, â€œI believe that intervention will be stronger than nonintervention. And...â€ he paused. â€œFinally one cannot impute the nonreceipt of our dispatch of November 18. That is how it will end.â€ And he released BolkÃ³nskiâ€™s arm to indicate that he had now quite finished.

â€œDemosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden mouth!â€ said BilÃ­bin, and the mop of hair on his head moved with satisfaction.

Everybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone. He was evidently distressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain the wild laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features.

â€œWell now, gentlemen,â€ said BilÃ­bin, â€œBolkÃ³nski is my guest in this house and in BrÃ¼nn itself. I want to entertain him as far as I can, with all the pleasures of life here. If we were in Vienna it would be easy, but here, in this wretched Moravian hole, it is more difficult, and I beg you all to help me. BrÃ¼nnâ€™s attractions must be shown him. You can undertake the theater, I society, and you, Hippolyte, of course the women.â€

â€œWe must let him see Amelie, sheâ€™s exquisite!â€ said one of â€œours,â€ kissing his finger tips.

â€œIn general we must turn this blnodthirsty soldier to more humane interests,â€ said BilÃ­bin.

â€œI shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality, gentlemen, it is already time for me to go,â€ replied Prince Andrew looking at his watch.

â€œWhere to?â€

â€œTo the Emperor.â€

â€œOh! Oh! Oh!â€

â€œWell, au revoir, BolkÃ³nski! Au revoir, Prince! Come back early to dinner,â€ cried several voices. â€œWeâ€™ll take you in hand.â€

â€œWhen speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise the way that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated,â€ said BilÃ­bin, accompanying him to the hall.

â€œI should like to speak well of them, but as far as I know the facts, I canâ€™t,â€ replied BolkÃ³nski, smiling.

â€œWell, talk as much as you can, anyway. He has a passion for giving audiences, but he does not like talking himself and canâ€™t do it, as you will see.â€

CHAPTER XII
At the levee Prince Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as he had been told to, and the Emperor Francis merely looked fixedly into his face and just nodded to him with his long head. But after it was over, the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed BolkÃ³nski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience. The Emperor Francis received him standing in the middle of the room. Before the conversation began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact that the Emperor seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say.

â€œTell me, when did the battle begin?â€ he asked hurriedly.

Prince Andrew replied. Then followed other questions just as simple: â€œWas KutÃºzov well? When had he left Krems?â€ and so on. The Emperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questionsâ€”the answers to these questions, as was only too evident, did not interest him.

â€œAt what oâ€™clock did the battle begin?â€ asked the Emperor.

â€œI cannot inform Your Majesty at what oâ€™clock the battle began at the front, but at DÃ¼rrenstein, where I was, our attack began after five in the afternoon,â€ replied BolkÃ³nski growing more animated and expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account, which he had ready in his mind, of all he knew and had seen. But the Emperor smiled and interrupted him.

â€œHow many miles?â€

â€œFrom where to where, Your Majesty?â€

â€œFrom DÃ¼rrenstein to Krems.â€

â€œThree and a half miles, Your Majesty.â€

â€œThe French have abandoned the left bank?â€

â€œAccording to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the night.â€

â€œIs there sufficient forage in Krems?â€

â€œForage has not been supplied to the extent...â€

The Emperor interrupted him.

â€œAt what oâ€™clock was General Schmidt killed?â€

â€œAt seven oâ€™clock, I believe.â€

â€œAt seven oâ€™clock? Itâ€™s very sad, very sad!â€

The Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed. Prince Andrew withdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides. Everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words. Yesterdayâ€™s adjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the palace, and offered him his own house. The Minister of War came up and congratulated him on the Maria Theresa Order of the third grade, which the Emperor was conferring on him. The Empressâ€™ chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty. The archduchess also wished to see him. He did not know whom to answer, and for a few seconds collected his thoughts. Then the Russian ambassador took him by the shoulder, led him to the window, and began to talk to him.

Contrary to BilÃ­binâ€™s forecast the news he had brought was joyfully received. A thanksgiving service was arranged, KutÃºzov was awarded the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army received rewards. BolkÃ³nski was invited everywhere, and had to spend the whole morning calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries. Between four and five in the afternoon, having made all his calls, he was returning to BilÃ­binâ€™s house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit to BrÃ¼nn. At the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage. Franz, BilÃ­binâ€™s man, was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door.

Before returning to BilÃ­binâ€™s Prince Andrew had gone to a bookshop to provide himself with some books for the campaign, and had spent some time in the shop.

â€œWhat is it?â€ he asked.

â€œOh, your excellency!â€ said Franz, with difficulty rolling the portmanteau into the vehicle, â€œwe are to move on still farther. The scoundrel is again at our heels!â€

â€œEh? What?â€ asked Prince Andrew.

BilÃ­bin came out to meet him. His usually calm face showed excitement.

â€œThere now! Confess that this is delightful,â€ said he. â€œThis affair of the Thabor Bridge, at Vienna.... They have crossed without striking a blow!â€

Prince Andrew could not understand.

â€œBut where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows?â€

â€œI come from the archduchessâ€™. I heard nothing there.â€

â€œAnd you didnâ€™t see that everybody is packing up?â€

â€œI did not... What is it all about?â€ inquired Prince Andrew impatiently.

â€œWhatâ€™s it all about? Why, the French have crossed the bridge that Auersperg was defending, and the bridge was not blown up: so Murat is now rushing along the road to BrÃ¼nn and will be here in a day or two.â€

â€œWhat? Here? But why did they not blow up the bridge, if it was mined?â€

â€œThat is what I ask you. No one, not even Bonaparte, knows why.â€

BolkÃ³nski shrugged his shoulders.

â€œBut if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost? It will be cut off,â€ said he.

â€œThatâ€™s just it,â€ answered BilÃ­bin. â€œListen! The French entered Vienna as I told you. Very well. Next day, which was yesterday, those gentlemen, messieurs les marÃ©chaux, * Murat, Lannes, and Belliard, mount and ride to the bridge. (Observe that all three are Gascons.) â€˜Gentlemen,â€™ says one of them, â€˜you know the Thabor Bridge is mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross? But it will please our sovereign the Emperor Napoleon if we take this bridge, so let us three go and take it!â€™ â€˜Yes, letâ€™s!â€™ say the others. And off they go and take the bridge, cross it, and now with their whole army are on this side of the Danube, marching on us, you, and your lines of communication.â€

* The marshalls.

â€œStop jesting,â€ said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously. This news grieved him and yet he was pleased.

As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it out of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame! Listening to BilÃ­bin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one that could save the army, and how he alone would be entrusted with the executing of the plan.

â€œStop this jesting,â€ he said.

â€œI am not jesting,â€ BilÃ­bin went on. â€œNothing is truer or sadder. These gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs; they assure the officer on duty that they, the marshals, are on their way to negotiate with Prince Auersperg. He lets them enter the tÃªte-de-pont. * They spin him a thousand gasconades, saying that the war is over, that the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with Bonaparte, that they desire to see Prince Auersperg, and so on. The officer sends for Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace the officers, crack jokes, sit on the cannon, and meanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge unobserved, flings the bags of incendiary material into the water, and approaches the tÃªte-de-pont. At length appears the lieutenant general, our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern himself. â€˜Dearest foe! Flower of the Austrian army, hero of the Turkish wars! Hostilities are ended, we can shake one anotherâ€™s hand.... The Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince Auerspergâ€™s acquaintance.â€™ In a word, those gentlemen, Gascons indeed, so bewildered him with fine words, and he is so flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the French marshals, and so dazzled by the sight of Muratâ€™s mantle and ostrich plumes, quâ€™il nâ€™y voit que du feu, et oublie celui quâ€™il devait faire faire sur lâ€™ennemi!â€ *(2) In spite of the animation of his speech, BilÃ­bin did not forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation. â€œThe French battalion rushes to the bridgehead, spikes the guns, and the bridge is taken! But what is best of all,â€ he went on, his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story, â€œis that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that the French troops were running onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes stayed his hand. The sergeant, who was evidently wiser than his general, goes up to Auersperg and says: â€˜Prince, you are being deceived, here are the French!â€™ Murat, seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak, turns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment (he is a true Gascon) and says: â€˜I donâ€™t recognize the world-famous Austrian discipline, if you allow a subordinate to address you like that!â€™ It was a stroke of genius. Prince Auersperg feels his dignity at stake and orders the sergeant to be arrested. Come, you must own that this affair of the Thabor Bridge is delightful! It is not exactly stupidity, nor rascality....â€

* Bridgehead.

* (2) That their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that he ought to be firing at the enemy.

â€œIt may be treachery,â€ said Prince Andrew, vividly imagining the gray overcoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of firing, and the glory that awaited him.

â€œNot that either. That puts the court in too bad a light,â€ replied BilÃ­bin. â€œItâ€™s not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity: it is just as at Ulm... it is...â€â€”he seemed to be trying to find the right expression. â€œCâ€™est... câ€™est du Mack. Nous sommes mackÃ©s (It is... it is a bit of Mack. We are Macked),â€ he concluded, feeling that he had produced a good epigram, a fresh one that would be repeated. His hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a slight smile he began to examine his nails.

â€œWhere are you off to?â€ he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had risen and was going toward his room.

â€œI am going away.â€

â€œWhere to?â€

â€œTo the army.â€

â€œBut you meant to stay another two days?â€

â€œBut now I am off at once.â€

And Prince Andrew after giving directions about his departure went to his room.

â€œDo you know, mon cher,â€ said BilÃ­bin following him, â€œI have been thinking about you. Why are you going?â€

And in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles vanished from his face.

Prince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply.

â€œWhy are you going? I know you think it your duty to gallop back to the army now that it is in danger. I understand that. Mon cher, it is heroism!â€

â€œNot at all,â€ said Prince Andrew.

â€œBut as you are a philosopher, be a consistent one, look at the other side of the question and you will see that your duty, on the contrary, is to take care of yourself. Leave it to those who are no longer fit for anything else.... You have not been ordered to return and have not been dismissed from here; therefore, you can stay and go with us wherever our ill luck takes us. They say we are going to OlmÃ¼tz, and OlmÃ¼tz is a very decent town. You and I will travel comfortably in my calÃ¨che.â€

â€œDo stop joking, BilÃ­bin,â€ cried BolkÃ³nski.

â€œI am speaking sincerely as a friend! Consider! Where and why are you going, when you might remain here? You are faced by one of two things,â€ and the skin over his left temple puckered, â€œeither you will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will share defeat and disgrace with KutÃºzovâ€™s whole army.â€

And BilÃ­bin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that the dilemma was insoluble.

â€œI cannot argue about it,â€ replied Prince Andrew coldly, but he thought: â€œI am going to save the army.â€

â€œMy dear fellow, you are a hero!â€ said BilÃ­bin.

CHAPTER XIII
That same night, having taken leave of the Minister of War, BolkÃ³nski set off to rejoin the army, not knowing where he would find it and fearing to be captured by the French on the way to Krems.

In BrÃ¼nn everybody attached to the court was packing up, and the heavy baggage was already being dispatched to OlmÃ¼tz. Near Hetzelsdorf Prince Andrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was moving with great haste and in the greatest disorder. The road was so obstructed with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage. Prince Andrew took a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander, and hungry and weary, making his way past the baggage wagons, rode in search of the commander in chief and of his own luggage. Very sinister reports of the position of the army reached him as he went along, and the appearance of the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors.

â€œCette armÃ©e russe que lâ€™or de lâ€™Angleterre a transportÃ©e des extrÃ©mitÃ©s de lâ€™univers, nous allons lui faire Ã©prouver le mÃªme sortâ€”(le sort de lâ€™armÃ©e dâ€™Ulm).â€ * He remembered these words in Bonaparteâ€™s address to his army at the beginning of the campaign, and they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero, a feeling of wounded pride, and a hope of glory. â€œAnd should there be nothing left but to die?â€ he thought. â€œWell, if need be, I shall do it no worse than others.â€

* â€œThat Russian army which has been brought from the ends of the earth by English gold, we shall cause to share the same fateâ€”(the fate of the army at Ulm).â€

He looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments, carts, guns, artillery, and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road, three and sometimes four abreast. From all sides, behind and before, as far as ear could reach, there were the rattle of wheels, the creaking of carts and gun carriages, the tramp of horses, the crack of whips, shouts, the urging of horses, and the swearing of soldiers, orderlies, and officers. All along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen, some flayed, some not, and broken-down carts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something, and again soldiers straggling from their companies, crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages, or returned from them dragging sheep, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks. At each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the din of shouting more incessant. Soldiers floundering knee-deep in mud pushed the guns and wagons themselves. Whips cracked, hoofs slipped, traces broke, and lungs were strained with shouting. The officers directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts. Their voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder.

â€œHere is our dear Orthodox Russian army,â€ thought BolkÃ³nski, recalling BilÃ­binâ€™s words.

Wishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up to a convoy. Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse vehicle, evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and looking like something between a cart, a cabriolet, and a calÃ¨che. A soldier was driving, and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the apron under the leather hood of the vehicle. Prince Andrew rode up and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle. An officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving the womanâ€™s vehicle for trying to get ahead of others, and the strokes of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage. The woman screamed piercingly. Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned out from behind the apron and, waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl, cried:

â€œMr. Aide-de-camp! Mr. Aide-de-camp!... For heavenâ€™s sake... Protect me! What will become of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh Chasseurs.... They wonâ€™t let us pass, we are left behind and have lost our people...â€

â€œIâ€™ll flatten you into a pancake!â€ shouted the angry officer to the soldier. â€œTurn back with your slut!â€

â€œMr. Aide-de-camp! Help me!... What does it all mean?â€ screamed the doctorâ€™s wife.

â€œKindly let this cart pass. Donâ€™t you see itâ€™s a woman?â€ said Prince Andrew riding up to the officer.

The officer glanced at him, and without replying turned again to the soldier. â€œIâ€™ll teach you to push on!... Back!â€

â€œLet them pass, I tell you!â€ repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his lips.

â€œAnd who are you?â€ cried the officer, turning on him with tipsy rage, â€œwho are you? Are you in command here? Eh? I am commander here, not you! Go back or Iâ€™ll flatten you into a pancake,â€ repeated he. This expression evidently pleased him.

â€œThat was a nice snub for the little aide-de-camp,â€ came a voice from behind.

Prince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless, tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying. He saw that his championship of the doctorâ€™s wife in her queer trap might expose him to what he dreaded more than anything in the worldâ€”to ridicule; but his instinct urged him on. Before the officer finished his sentence Prince Andrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised his riding whip.

â€œKind...ly letâ€”themâ€”pass!â€

The officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away.

â€œItâ€™s all the fault of these fellows on the staff that thereâ€™s this disorder,â€ he muttered. â€œDo as you like.â€

Prince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the doctorâ€™s wife, who was calling him her deliverer, and recalling with a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he galloped on to the village where he was told who the commander in chief was.

On reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house, intending to rest if but for a moment, eat something, and try to sort out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind. â€œThis is a mob of scoundrels and not an army,â€ he was thinking as he went up to the window of the first house, when a familiar voice called him by name.

He turned round. NesvÃ­tskiâ€™s handsome face looked out of the little window. NesvÃ­tski, moving his moist lips as he chewed something, and flourishing his arm, called him to enter.

â€œBolkÃ³nski! BolkÃ³nski!... Donâ€™t you hear? Eh? Come quick...â€ he shouted.

Entering the house, Prince Andrew saw NesvÃ­tski and another adjutant having something to eat. They hastily turned round to him asking if he had any news. On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm. This was particularly noticeable on NesvÃ­tskiâ€™s usually laughing countenance.

â€œWhere is the commander in chief?â€ asked BolkÃ³nski.

â€œHere, in that house,â€ answered the adjutant.

â€œWell, is it true that itâ€™s peace and capitulation?â€ asked NesvÃ­tski.

â€œI was going to ask you. I know nothing except that it was all I could do to get here.â€

â€œAnd we, my dear boy! Itâ€™s terrible! I was wrong to laugh at Mack, weâ€™re getting it still worse,â€ said NesvÃ­tski. â€œBut sit down and have something to eat.â€

â€œYou wonâ€™t be able to find either your baggage or anything else now, Prince. And God only knows where your man Peter is,â€ said the other adjutant.

â€œWhere are headquarters?â€

â€œWe are to spend the night in Znaim.â€

â€œWell, I have got all I need into packs for two horses,â€ said NesvÃ­tski. â€œTheyâ€™ve made up splendid packs for meâ€”fit to cross the Bohemian mountains with. Itâ€™s a bad lookout, old fellow! But whatâ€™s the matter with you? You must be ill to shiver like that,â€ he added, noticing that Prince Andrew winced as at an electric shock.

â€œItâ€™s nothing,â€ replied Prince Andrew.

He had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctorâ€™s wife and the convoy officer.

â€œWhat is the commander in chief doing here?â€ he asked.

â€œI canâ€™t make out at all,â€ said NesvÃ­tski.

â€œWell, all I can make out is that everything is abominable, abominable, quite abominable!â€ said Prince Andrew, and he went off to the house where the commander in chief was.

Passing by KutÃºzovâ€™s carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his suite, with their Cossacks who were talking loudly together, Prince Andrew entered the passage. KutÃºzov himself, he was told, was in the house with Prince BagratiÃ³n and Weyrother. Weyrother was the Austrian general who had succeeded Schmidt. In the passage little KozlÃ³vski was squatting on his heels in front of a clerk. The clerk, with cuffs turned up, was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards. KozlÃ³vskiâ€™s face looked wornâ€”he too had evidently not slept all night. He glanced at Prince Andrew and did not even nod to him.

â€œSecond line... have you written it?â€ he continued dictating to the clerk. â€œThe Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian...â€

â€œOne canâ€™t write so fast, your honor,â€ said the clerk, glancing angrily and disrespectfully at KozlÃ³vski.

Through the door came the sounds of KutÃºzovâ€™s voice, excited and dissatisfied, interrupted by another, an unfamiliar voice. From the sound of these voices, the inattentive way KozlÃ³vski looked at him, the disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk, the fact that the clerk and KozlÃ³vski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander in chief, and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding the horses near the window, Prince Andrew felt that something important and disastrous was about to happen.

He turned to KozlÃ³vski with urgent questions.

â€œImmediately, Prince,â€ said KozlÃ³vski. â€œDispositions for BagratiÃ³n.â€

â€œWhat about capitulation?â€

â€œNothing of the sort. Orders are issued for a battle.â€

Prince Andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard. Just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased, the door opened, and KutÃºzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway. Prince Andrew stood right in front of KutÃºzov but the expression of the commander in chiefâ€™s one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence. He looked straight at his adjutantâ€™s face without recognizing him.

â€œWell, have you finished?â€ said he to KozlÃ³vski.

â€œOne moment, your excellency.â€

BagratiÃ³n, a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm, impassive face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in chief.

â€œI have the honor to present myself,â€ repeated Prince Andrew rather loudly, handing KutÃºzov an envelope.

â€œAh, from Vienna? Very good. Later, later!â€

KutÃºzov went out into the porch with BagratiÃ³n.

â€œWell, good-by, Prince,â€ said he to BagratiÃ³n. â€œMy blessing, and may Christ be with you in your great endeavor!â€

His face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes. With his left hand he drew BagratiÃ³n toward him, and with his right, on which he wore a ring, he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently habitual, offering his puffy cheek, but BagratiÃ³n kissed him on the neck instead.

â€œChrist be with you!â€ KutÃºzov repeated and went toward his carriage. â€œGet in with me,â€ said he to BolkÃ³nski.

â€œYour excellency, I should like to be of use here. Allow me to remain with Prince BagratiÃ³nâ€™s detachment.â€

â€œGet in,â€ said KutÃºzov, and noticing that BolkÃ³nski still delayed, he added: â€œI need good officers myself, need them myself!â€

They got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence.

â€œThere is still much, much before us,â€ he said, as if with an old manâ€™s penetration he understood all that was passing in BolkÃ³nskiâ€™s mind. â€œIf a tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God,â€ he added as if speaking to himself.

Prince Andrew glanced at KutÃºzovâ€™s face only a foot distant from him and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his temple, where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull, and the empty eye socket. â€œYes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those menâ€™s death,â€ thought BolkÃ³nski.

â€œThat is why I beg to be sent to that detachment,â€ he said.

KutÃºzov did not reply. He seemed to have forgotten what he had been saying, and sat plunged in thought. Five minutes later, gently swaying on the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince Andrew. There was not a trace of agitation on his face. With delicate irony he questioned Prince Andrew about the details of his interview with the Emperor, about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the Krems affair, and about some ladies they both knew.

CHAPTER XIV
On November 1 KutÃºzov had received, through a spy, news that the army he commanded was in an almost hopeless position. The spy reported that the French, after crossing the bridge at Vienna, were advancing in immense force upon KutÃºzovâ€™s line of communication with the troops that were arriving from Russia. If KutÃºzov decided to remain at Krems, Napoleonâ€™s army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand, and he would find himself in the position of Mack at Ulm. If KutÃºzov decided to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from Russia, he would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian mountains, defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning all hope of a junction with BuxhÃ¶wden. If KutÃºzov decided to retreat along the road from Krems to OlmÃ¼tz, to unite with the troops arriving from Russia, he risked being forestalled on that road by the French who had crossed the Vienna bridge, and encumbered by his baggage and transport, having to accept battle on the march against an enemy three times as strong, who would hem him in from two sides.

KutÃºzov chose this latter course.

The French, the spy reported, having crossed the Vienna bridge, were advancing by forced marches toward Znaim, which lay sixty-six miles off on the line of KutÃºzovâ€™s retreat. If he reached Znaim before the French, there would be great hope of saving the army; to let the French forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a disgrace such as that of Ulm, or to utter destruction. But to forestall the French with his whole army was impossible. The road for the French from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the road for the Russians from Krems to Znaim.

The night he received the news, KutÃºzov sent BagratiÃ³nâ€™s vanguard, four thousand strong, to the right across the hills from the Krems-Znaim to the Vienna-Znaim road. BagratiÃ³n was to make this march without resting, and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and if he succeeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as possible. KutÃºzov himself with all his transport took the road to Znaim.

Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, with his hungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the way, BagratiÃ³n came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at HollabrÃ¼nn a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching HollabrÃ¼nn from Vienna. KutÃºzov with his transport had still to march for some days before he could reach Znaim. Hence BagratiÃ³n with his four thousand hungry, exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army that came upon him at HollabrÃ¼nn, which was clearly impossible. But a freak of fate made the impossible possible. The success of the trick that had placed the Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without a fight led Murat to try to deceive KutÃºzov in a similar way. Meeting BagratiÃ³nâ€™s weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be KutÃºzovâ€™s whole army. To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna, and with this object offered a three daysâ€™ truce on condition that both armies should remain in position without moving. Murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that he therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Count Nostitz, the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, believed Muratâ€™s emissary and retired, leaving BagratiÃ³nâ€™s division exposed. Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the Russian army the three daysâ€™ truce. BagratiÃ³n replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to KutÃºzov to report the offer he had received.

A truce was KutÃºzovâ€™s sole chance of gaining time, giving BagratiÃ³nâ€™s exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport and heavy convoys (whose movements were concealed from the French) advance if but one stage nearer Znaim. The offer of a truce gave the only, and a quite unexpected, chance of saving the army. On receiving the news he immediately dispatched Adjutant General Wintzingerode, who was in attendance on him, to the enemy camp. Wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation, and meanwhile KutÃºzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the Krems-Znaim road. BagratiÃ³nâ€™s exhausted and hungry detachment, which alone covered this movement of the transport and of the whole army, had to remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself.

KutÃºzovâ€™s expectations that the proposals of capitulation (which were in no way binding) might give time for part of the transport to pass, and also that Muratâ€™s mistake would very soon be discovered, proved correct. As soon as Bonaparte (who was at SchÃ¶nbrunn, sixteen miles from HollabrÃ¼nn) received Muratâ€™s dispatch with the proposal of a truce and a capitulation, he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to Murat:

SchÃ¶nbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805,

at eight oâ€™clock in the morning

To PRINCE MURAT,

I cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. You command only my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice without my order. You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign. Break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him that the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no one but the Emperor of Russia has that right.

If, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention, I will ratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the Russian army.... You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery.

The Russian Emperorâ€™s aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are nothing when they have no powers; this one had none.... The Austrians let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna bridge, you are letting yourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp of the Emperor.

NAPOLEON

Bonaparteâ€™s adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to Murat. Bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved with all the Guards to the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready victim escape, and BagratiÃ³nâ€™s four thousand men merrily lighted campfires, dried and warmed themselves, cooked their porridge for the first time for three days, and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store for him.

CHAPTER XV
Between three and four oâ€™clock in the afternoon Prince Andrew, who had persisted in his request to KutÃºzov, arrived at Grunth and reported himself to BagratiÃ³n. Bonaparteâ€™s adjutant had not yet reached Muratâ€™s detachment and the battle had not yet begun. In BagratiÃ³nâ€™s detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs. They talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility; others talked of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement. BagratiÃ³n, knowing BolkÃ³nski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant, received him with distinction and special marks of favor, explaining to him that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next, and giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat, â€œwhich is also very important.â€

â€œHowever, there will hardly be an engagement today,â€ said BagratiÃ³n as if to reassure Prince Andrew.

â€œIf he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard, but if he wishes to stay with me, let him... heâ€™ll be of use here if heâ€™s a brave officer,â€ thought BagratiÃ³n. Prince Andrew, without replying, asked the princeâ€™s permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of the forces, so as to know his bearings should he be sent to execute an order. The officer on duty, a handsome, elegantly dressed man with a diamond ring on his forefinger, who was fond of speaking French though he spoke it badly, offered to conduct Prince Andrew.

On all sides they saw rain-soaked officers with dejected faces who seemed to be seeking something, and soldiers dragging doors, benches, and fencing from the village.

â€œThere now, Prince! We canâ€™t stop those fellows,â€ said the staff officer pointing to the soldiers. â€œThe officers donâ€™t keep them in hand. And there,â€ he pointed to a sutlerâ€™s tent, â€œthey crowd in and sit. This morning I turned them all out and now look, itâ€™s full again. I must go there, Prince, and scare them a bit. It wonâ€™t take a moment.â€

â€œYes, letâ€™s go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese,â€ said Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything.

â€œWhy didnâ€™t you mention it, Prince? I would have offered you something.â€

They dismounted and entered the tent. Several officers, with flushed and weary faces, were sitting at the table eating and drinking.

â€œNow what does this mean, gentlemen?â€ said the staff officer, in the reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more than once. â€œYou know it wonâ€™t do to leave your posts like this. The prince gave orders that no one should leave his post. Now you, Captain,â€ and he turned to a thin, dirty little artillery officer who without his boots (he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry), in only his stockings, rose when they entered, smiling not altogether comfortably.

â€œWell, arenâ€™t you ashamed of yourself, Captain TÃºshin?â€ he continued. â€œOne would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good example, yet here you are without your boots! The alarm will be sounded and youâ€™ll be in a pretty position without your boots!â€ (The staff officer smiled.) â€œKindly return to your posts, gentlemen, all of you, all!â€ he added in a tone of command.

Prince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer TÃºshin, who silent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged foot to the other, glanced inquiringly with his large, intelligent, k`9 t 0A !$nd .$`  ( b! h! dh Fen u d2Iu`$`A@ `($f%0  A @ady  !d 4@ q abd&1 a`$ h`"t b` *k ,0h `a(( HD0% "op À	 .`dr ‚€œ@C(%p& €˜"(` 4C `!`a epj`#
